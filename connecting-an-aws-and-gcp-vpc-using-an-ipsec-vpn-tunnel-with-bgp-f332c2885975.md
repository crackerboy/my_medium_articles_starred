# Connecting an AWS and GCP VPC using an IPSec VPN Tunnel with BGP

The Peek booking platform processes thousands of tours, activities, and rentals each day. Behind the scenes, the DevOps team here has always been early adopters of containerizing our applications using Docker, and deploying these container using Kubernetes, and Helm. In addition to containerization, we have strived to move toward applying Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and leveraging tools such as Terraform across our fleet of services in both AWS and GCP.

As part of Peek‚Äôs journey this year, our focus turned to creating a multi-cloud environment using AWS and GCP. The goal was to have our private services and databases exist in either cloud provider VPC, and still be able to easily communicate with each other. To achieve a production ready infrastructure, we needed a solution that was also redundant. Our solution came down to setting up a high availability IPSec VPN Tunnel.

This guide will illustrate how to assemble the VPN tunnels between both cloud providers. As a quick overview, on both sides we‚Äôll have a VPC with a public subnet and a private subnet. The public subnet we will use to create a bastion to access a private host in the private subnet. The private hosts in AWS and GCP will be able to communicate with each other after the VPN tunnels has been established. In order for the VPN to be production ready, we will need to setup a High Availability (HA) Cloud VPN on the GCP side and two Site-to-Site VPN Connections on the AWS side. This will form four total VPN Tunnels. Each VPN tunnel will also use dynamic BGP routing to determine the CIDR ranges from each VPC.

Here is a diagram of what the resulting network configuration will look like:

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you will need admin access to an AWS account as well as admin access to a GCP project. A VPC network in each cloud provider with CIDR ranges that do not overlap. Each network should have a private subnet, and a NAT in order to enable egress on private instances. The following configuration values will be used:

**AWS**

* A VPC with a public and private subnet in us-east-1, making sure the CIDR range is not conflicting on the GCP side.

* VPC with a CIDR range of 10.0.0.0/16

* A public subnet with range of 10.0.0.0/24

* A private subnet with range of 10.0.0.1/24

* An instance in the private subnet to test the VPN Tunnel with ICMP and port 22 opened.

**GCP**

* A VPC with a public and private subnet in us-east4, making sure the CIDR range is not conflicting with the AWS side.

* VPC with a CIDR range of 10.10.0.0/16

* A public subnet with range of 10.10.0.0/24

* A private subnet with range of 10.10.0.1/24

* An instance in the private subnet to test the VPN Tunnel with ICMP and port 22 opened.

## Overview

GCP has two types of VPN Gateways you can create, classic and High Availability(HA). We will be creating the HA version of the VPN gateway which will allow us to achieve 99.99% SLA. In addition to this gateway, we must create 4 tunnels between GCP and AWS. On the AWS side, we will need to create two Customer Gateways and two Site-To-Site VPN connections.

## Steps

We will be bouncing between GCP and AWS, so sections for each provider are carefully demarcated ‚ÄúGCP Side‚Äù or ‚ÄúAWS Side‚Äù

**GCP Side**

1. Go to your GCP project, in the left nav bar, *go down to Hybrid Connectivity, select ‚ÄúCloud Routers‚Äù. Click ‚ÄúCreate Router‚Äù*

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vMtsK_uuKr29me5KQzWhew.png)

2. In ‚ÄúCreate a Cloud Router‚Äù, fill in the following. *Click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù*

* Name: gcp-sandbox-to-aws-sandbox-cloud-router

* Description: (blank or anything you want)

* Network: gcp-sandbox

* Region: us-east4 (Northern Virginia)

* Google ASN: 64520 (You can use any private ASN (64512‚Äì65534). Make sure it doesn‚Äôt conflict with the ASN in the AWS side later)
**Note: 4200000000‚Äì4294967294 is not allowed in AWS so don‚Äôt use this range.*

* Select ‚ÄúAdvertise all subnets visible to the Cloud Router (Default)‚Äù

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*cz6FeUA2FblDzv4Prt4vXQ.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*zg9YyIxlFufNGpTNxdNdfw.png)

11. Fill in the following. *Click ‚ÄúCreate Virtual Private Gateway‚Äù*

* Name tag: aws-sandbox-to-gcp-sandbox-vpg

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5316/1*iJbEE2kSdq8cMMAyAtHtRQ.png)

12. After the creation, look in the list of Virtual Private Gateways, select the gateway you just created (aws-sandbox-to-gcp-sandbox-vpg). *Right click on the gateway and ‚ÄúAttach to VPC‚Äù.*

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Jas8uUxONP7YQ5Dq54COcA.png)

13. In the following screen, select the VPC you want to connect with GCP (AWS Sandbox). *Click ‚ÄúYes, Attach‚Äù.* The state will show ‚Äúattached‚Äù

**Note: As of 7/22/2020, the [documentation from GCP](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/how-to/creating-ha-vpn) states to ‚ÄúCreate two AWS Virtual Private Gateways‚Äù. This is not correct, since you can only attach one Virtual Private Gateway to the VPC. If you attempt to attach a second Virtual Private Gateway, it will throw an error*

15. In ‚ÄúCreate VPN Connection‚Äù, fill in the following. **Do not click ‚ÄúCreate VPN Connection‚Äù yet. **We need to change the Tunnel Options which is detailed in the next step.

* Customer Gateway: Existing

* Customer Gateway: cgw-05ec02a5c083d0ef6 (name tag: aws-sandbox-to-gcp-sandbox-cg1). *Select the first Customer Gateway you created that matches Tunnel 0 in GCP.*

* Routing Options: Dynamic

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4276/1*TU2n-sZ9vd94f3wHW9-MKQ.png)

16. Tunnel Options. Normally we do not need to alter the tunnel options, however there is a known compatibility issue with the size of the AWS transform set, which is larger than GCP will accept. This causes the GCP Cloud VPN Tunnel rekey process to fail. You can read more about this [here](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/how-to/creating-ha-vpn).

We reduced the transform sets to use the following options.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2948/1*FsweTWCv-9bl5_jKnN6G6Q.png)

Repeat the same Advanced Options for Tunnel 2. *Click ‚ÄúCreate VPN Connection‚Äù*

* Platform: Generic

* Software: Vendor Agnostic

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*DOOpWPjxt5X7xXu6mBRS3g.png)

*Click ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù* to save the Configuration for use later when we go back to GCP (file name should be <vpn id.txt>).

18. Create a second Site-to-Site VPN Connection by repeating steps 14 to 17. The second Site-to-Site VPN Connection should have the following values.

* Name tag: aws-sandbox-to-gcp-sandbox-vpn2

* Target Gateway Type: Virtual Private Gateway

* Virtual Private Gateway: vgw-00a6862ef16d8404e (name tag: aws-sandbox-to-gcp-sandbox-vpg). *Select the Virtual Private Gateway you just created.*

* Customer Gateway: Existing

* Customer Gateway: cgw-02852ebb8f7e7b000 (name tag: aws-sandbox-to-gcp-sandbox-cg2). *Select the second Customer Gateway you created that matches Tunnel 1 in GCP.*

* Routing Options: Dynamic

**GCP Side**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4996/1*-3AiSYcdv6lfZAFN-8yyfQ.png)

41. Verify it all works ‚Äî For this tutorial my test bastions use the following ips:

* AWS ‚Äî 10.0.1.220

* GCP ‚Äî 10.10.1.2

SSH into the AWS host (10.0.1.220) in the private subnet. Ping the GCP host (10.10.1.2) which exist in the GCP private subnet. You can also run a netcat nc -zv 10.10.1.2 22 to confirm that it is also allowing connections.

    ubuntu@ip-10-0-1-220:~$ ping 10.10.1.2

Let us do the opposite. We‚Äôll ping and netcat the AWS host (10.0.1.220) from the GCP host (10.10.1.2).

    ubuntu@app-service:~$ nc -zv 10.0.1.220 22

## Summary

Obviously setting up cross-cloud networking with high-availability is an involved process with many components, and requires a considerable effort to stay on top of all the gotchas. Hardening a setup of this nature is made possible by leveraging automation using tools like gcloud, aws-cli, or Terraform.

Now that we have a solid, highly available VPN connection across providers, we can connect services like CloudSQL to AWS.
