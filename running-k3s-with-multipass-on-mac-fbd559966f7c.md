# Running K3s with Multipass on Mac

K3s is the lightweight Kubernetes distribution that is just freshly baked. As its lightweight, itâ€™s ideal to run on a laptop for a developer to explore and experiment with it. But K3s is natively available for Linux. How can we run it on Mac?

Entering Multipass. First, let's install the multipass with the brew.

    brew search multipass
    brew cask install multipass

Now create a VM with multipass, assuming 1GB memory and 5GB disk.

    multipass launch --name k3s --mem 1G --disk 5G
    Launched: k3s

Wait for the VM created, then open a shell to the VM,

    multipass shell k3s

We have the shell for the VM then, run curl -sfL [https://get.k3s.io](https://get.k3s.io) | sh - to install K3s.

Then we have K3s installed and running on Macbook. Validate it with kubectl

    multipass@k3s:~$ kubectl get nodes
