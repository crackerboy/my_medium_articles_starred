If you’re a coffee drinker, before being fully prepared for the day, you have to go through a routine where you ready your coffee, then wait for it to heat up. How much better would this be if you ready it the night before, then simply push a button on your phone to get things going right from your bed?

Michael Krumpus of nootropic design decided he needed this ability, and wired up an outlet with a relay and an [Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266](https://www.hackster.io/adafruit/products/adafruit-feather-huzzah-with-esp8266-wifi) board to control his coffee maker. Now, with a properly prepared device, he could hit a button on his MQTT Dash app and a cup o’ joe is magically brewed for him.

It’s a [simple and clean concept](https://nootropicdesign.com/projectlab/2017/08/26/wifi-iot-electrical-outlet/) that could be applied beyond producing a caffeine jolt in the morning!
