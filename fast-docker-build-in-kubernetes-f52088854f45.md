# Fast Docker build in Kubernetes

Speed up docker build with cache in Kubernetes environment

This article describes my recent approach to do fast docker build with the DOCKER_BUILDKIT enhancement introduced since 18.09, and within a Kubernetes environment.

Below is the diagram.

Note: To perform the demo in this article, a running Kubernetes cluster is required.

## Background

Docker caching layer is very important for a fast docker build when you change a little bit in a large Dockerfile. There are many articles to describe this. [[1](https://testdriven.io/blog/faster-ci-builds-with-docker-cache/)], [[2](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/docker-layer-caching/)]

In my earlier docker build tasks designed a year ago, my method is to directly use a host machine with docker daemon running. As shown in below diagram.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2228/1*ndo8_q6Ou5TXoOYOG2D_Kg.png)

It is straight-forward and works, with some drawbacks‚Ä¶

* It‚Äôs not highly available. All docker build tasks depend on this host

* As time goes by, the storage space used by docker cache has grown to hundreds of Gigabytes

* And even worse, I didn‚Äôt find a way to manage the docker cache. So I couldn‚Äôt selectively purge some obsolete cached layers and keep the useful ones

* If the build cache is purged for whatever reason, all image builds start from scratch. And it happened‚Ä¶

* Before Buildkit enhancement, multi-stage-multi-target Dockerfile build unused stages unnecessarily.

Recently I‚Äôm trying to do 3 improvements to the tasks. [This article](https://ownyourbits.com/2019/05/13/building-docker-containers-in-2019/) helped a lot to refresh my design.

* Switching to Kubernetes cluster to run docker build in a Pod

* Make use of cache-from to resolve cache problem

* Make use of DOCKER_BUILDKIT enhancement

### Switching docker build to Kubernetes

While moving most infrastructures into Kubernetes, I found I have to keep this single docker host for this single purpose of ‚Äúdocker image building‚Äù.

There are 2 major differences to run docker build with a docker host and within a pod in Kubernetes.

1. A dedicate Docker host provides the same ‚Äúenv‚Äù for each ‚Äúdocker build‚Äô task, while Kubernetes provides a different Pod every time.

1. Docker host has the permanent storage for cached layers, while a pod has not.

There are a few ways to do docker build in Kubernetes, introduced in [this article](https://medium.com/hootsuite-engineering/building-docker-images-inside-kubernetes-42c6af855f25). I choose the same ‚Äúdocker in docker‚Äù approach as the author. I choose this way for its ease of use and the flexibility to use a version of docker of my choice.

For demo purpose I created a sample pod as below. In this article I will build a docker image for Doxygen, hosted [*here](https://github.com/liejuntao001/docker_doxygen). *The built image is in dockerhub as ‚Äúbaibai/doxygen:latest‚Äù, [*link](https://hub.docker.com/r/baibai/doxygen/)*.

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/ff9defcd986ca8596e9dd0e9cdfe6f95" frameborder=0></iframe>

In this pod, there are 2 containers.

First container is named ‚Äúdocker‚Äù, using ‚Äúdocker:19.03.3-git‚Äù image. Version 19.03.3 is the latest at the time of writing this article. It‚Äôs newer than the docker version running on the host machine for the Kubernetes cluster. ‚Äú19.03.3-git‚Äù the git variant provides git command to do build directly from remote git. ‚Äúdocker build‚Äù command will be run from this container.

Second one is named ‚Äúdind‚Äù, using ‚Äú docker:19.03.3-dind‚Äù image. This is the docker-in-docker daemon which will actually do the docker build. DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR is defined as empty to disable TLS verification.

The first container connects to the docker daemon provided by second container, over tcp://localhost:2375.

So let‚Äôs try to do the build in the pod. Example as below.

    $ kubectl apply -f docker_build.yml
    $ kubectl get pod
    NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    docker-build                        2/2     Running   0          17m
    $ kubectl exec -it docker-build -c docker sh
    / #

    / # docker build [https://github.com/liejuntao001/docker_doxygen.git](https://github.com/liejuntao001/docker_doxygen.git)

One thing that‚Äôs written right in the document but I ignored at the beginning is to add .git at the end of the github URL. Otherwise I saw an error message ‚ÄúError response from daemon: Dockerfile parse error line 7: unknown instruction: <!DOCTYPE‚Äù.

    docker build [https://github.com/liejuntao001/docker_doxygen**.git](https://github.com/liejuntao001/docker_doxygen.git)**

### Make use of cache-from

The ‚Äúcache-from‚Äù parameter would help resolve the build caching problem. Instead of using the cached layers in local storage, several remote images could be used as references. These 2 article [[1](https://andrewlock.net/caching-docker-layers-on-serverless-build-hosts-with-multi-stage-builds---target,-and---cache-from/)] [[2](https://testdriven.io/blog/faster-ci-builds-with-docker-cache/)] helped me to get an understanding.

As we don‚Äôt have any cache when a new Pod is created for each ‚Äúdocker build‚Äù task, we have to get some caches from existing images and hope the build to reuse as much as possible.

The usage of ‚Äúcache-from‚Äù is like below pattern. It need a docker Registry to pull images. After build, push the built images to Registry for next-time usage.

    # pull the images that will be referred as cache
    docker pull somethings
    # build
    docker build --tag somethings --cache-from somethings
    # push for next time build
    docker push somethings

Example below shows with the help of cache-from image, the ‚Äúdocker build‚Äù took only 1 second, if there is no change in Dockerfile.

    # Remember to delete the pod and create a fresh one

    $ kubectl exec -it docker-build -c docker sh
    / # docker system prune -a
    WARNING! This will remove:
      - all stopped containers
      - all networks not used by at least one container
      - all images without at least one container associated to them
      - all build cache

As it actually takes time to pull images from Registry, it‚Äôs better to use a private Registry sitting next to the build environment.

### Make use of DOCKER_BUILDKIT enhancement

There are some introduction articles about the enhancement introduced in 18.09. [[1](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/)] [[2](https://blog.mobyproject.org/introducing-buildkit-17e056cc5317)]

I‚Äôm mostly interested in this point:

* Detect and skip executing unused build stages

Prior to BUILDKIT enhancement, in multi-stage-multi-target Dockerfile, a target defined in the latter part of Dockerfile might be built with some unnecessary stages.

In below example, target2 doesn‚Äôt depend on target1. But if I want to build target2, target1 will be built unnecessarily. If there is any change in target1, it invalidate the caching to cause a re-build of target2.

    stage common1
    stage common2
    stage common3
    stage pre-targer1
    stage target1
    stage pre-target2
    stage target2

First try to do build with Buildkit, oops, I hit an error

So this build works, and it took 373 seconds.

### Build with DOCKER_BUILDKIT and cache-from

In this build, it seems although it tried to do ‚Äúimporting cache manifest from baibai/doxygen:latest 0.6s‚Äù, but it‚Äôs not effective for the apt command. Maybe this is because the existing image is built without Buildkit?

So next experiment, I tried to do similar as previous build with cache-from, e.g first pull the image, then do the build. The image from the Registry is already built with DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1

    # remember to delete the pod and create a fresh one

    # this version of baibai/doxygen:latest is built from previous command with DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1

Same thing, it still didn‚Äôt use cache for step 2/4 the apt step. So far we couldn‚Äôt use cache when build with DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1.

### A secret parameter

I‚Äôve searched quite lot and finally found a hint [here](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/38815), that the parameter ‚Äú ‚Äî build-arg BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1‚Äù is mentioned. There is brief explanation in buildx document [here](https://github.com/docker/buildx#--cache-tonametypetypekeyvalue).
> --build-arg BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1 can be used to trigger inline cache exporter
> Export build cache to an external cache destination‚Ä¶inline writes the cache metadata into the image configuration

I believe there should be more clear instructions about this parameter‚Ä¶

A rebuild is required, as the cache metadata is embedded in the image.

    # remember to delete the pod and create a fresh one

    / # DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build [https://github.com/liejuntao001/docker_doxygen.git](https://github.com/liejuntao001/docker_doxygen.git) --build-arg BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1 --tag baibai/doxygen:latest --cache-fro
    m baibai/doxygen:latest
    ...

    / # docker push baibai/doxygen:latest

Now the image that we pushed to Registry is built with BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1.

Check what happens if we do the build again

    # remember to delete the pod and create a fresh one

    / # DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build [https://github.com/liejuntao001/docker_doxygen.git](https://github.com/liejuntao001/docker_doxygen.git) --build-arg BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1 --tag baibai/doxygen:latest --cache-from baibai/doxygen:latest

So it works!

In the 1st second of the build, ‚Äúimporting cache manifest from baibai/doxygen:latest‚Äù has confirmed match of all layer:

    => CACHED [2/4]
    => CACHED [3/4]
    => CACHED [4/4]

The build time of 44 seconds was actually spent to pull the image from the Registry.

Note in the build, I could ignore the pattern of ‚Äúdocker pull‚Äù. Unlike the 3 step pattern ‚Äúdocker pull; docker build; docker push‚Äù, when building with ‚ÄúDOCKER_BUILDKIT=1‚Äù, the build step will pull the caching images automatically.
> # TL;DR

Create a Pod for docker build task from [this template](https://gist.github.com/liejuntao001/19b0f08a034c9866af8311144d8e7689).

Use below method to build your docker images in Kubernetes.

     DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --build-arg BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1 --tag docker_image_name:latest --cache-from docker_image_name:latest .
    docker push docker_image_name:latest

Thanks for reading.

*UPDATE 10/19/2019*

I found a problem when building real images. I wrote down the problem and solution in my article ‚ÄúFix Docker in docker network issue in Kubernetes‚Äù ([link](https://medium.com/@liejuntao001/fix-docker-in-docker-network-issue-in-kubernetes-cc18c229d9e5)). The Pod template has been updated to reflect the fix.

Based on this article, I‚Äôm building a Jenkins pipeline for docker image build task. To be continued‚Ä¶
