Christmas is over. New Years is almost here. Which means it’s time for my Top 50 Songs of the Year list. Can you fathom how many air horns went off in people’s hearts as I announced that?

Before I get to this year’s list, here are the entries from the past few years:

* [2016](https://arcdigital.media/the-top-75-songs-of-2016-112d5568fa63?source=friends_link&sk=1f5b4c63cbb3ee0bd1522226f961a081)

* [2017](https://arcdigital.media/the-top-50-songs-of-2017-421dc06c8997?source=friends_link&sk=30995e223233e07088d028b74aa8c7cb)

* [2018](https://arcdigital.media/the-top-50-songs-of-2018-ce0139a21d04?source=friends_link&sk=a0e2cc4b00c4934a65e1f3bcbca1931f)

And here’s my [philosophy of pop music](https://arcdigital.media/pop-music-is-forever-b86ed82c2ee4?source=friends_link&sk=487473d949185348e2109057c38dfe08), which helps convey the vibe I’m on.

Without further ado, here are the picks for 2019.

### 50. “Number One Fan” — MUNA

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wqf-U_fibV0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

I tend to think lyrics are epiphenomenal to a song’s quality, but MUNA’s meditation on loving yourself in a time of Listener Outrage is extremely good.

When they make you feel this:
> So I heard the bad news
Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die alone

Opt for this instead:
> Oh my God, like, I’m your number one fan
So iconic, like big, like stan, like
I would give my life just to hold your hand
I’m your number one fan
I’m your number one, number one fan

### 49. “Fuck Up The City” — PnB Rock (feat. Quavo)

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bNbwZ7WZbaA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

If ever there was a vibe custom-built for Quavo, this would be it.

When he auto-tune stretches *“they wanna know whyyyyyyyy y yyyyyy” *I have to admit that I do, in fact, want to know why.

### 48. “Getting Late” — Syd

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2r5beVs-3s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Hard to know which element packs more seductive power: the falsetto or the bassline.

### 47. “I’ve Got You” (Rinzen Remix) — Lastlings

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53nPV-H6Mz4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

The Australian duo gives us one of the best electroballads of the year.

### 46. “Roasted” — Konradsen

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EREDZ7VnADM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Norwegian duo Konradsen’s “Roasted” is beautiful multilayered folk fusion.

Lead singer Jenny Sabel sounds like Minnie Mouse as a grandmother, but…it somehow works.

### 45. “Meet Again” — Maxo Kream

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VpmuI_kyEeQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

“Meet Again” is one of the most arresting songs of the year. The realness is palpable.

The main character isn’t Maxo or his various family members and friends locked up in prison. The main character is prison itself.
> Let me tell you ‘bout your daughter, yesterday, she tried to walk
> Every day, she gettin’ smarter, other day, she tried to talk
> You can’t be there like a father and it’s fuckin’ with you mentally
> Court-appointed lawyer got my bro a half a century

### 44. “Peach Sky” — Bat for Lashes

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZRiiPalFHo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Not on the level of 2009’s earth-shattering “Daniel,” but Natasha Khan is still a Synthpop Queen.

Honorable mention from this year’s *Lost Girls*: “Mountains.”

### 43. “Kings & Queens” — DJ Shadow (feat. Run The Jewels)

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/puZISWdqCIE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Run The Jewels’ El-P basically transforms his family dog’s desperation into a Ted Talk. Does this sound silly? Follow along with his verse and just try to stave off feeling inspired as hell at the end. You can’t do it. It’s too transformative.

Beautiful production and message.

### 42. “Seventeen” — Sharon Van Etten

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7sTHoeH0eA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Ostensibly a coming-of-age song; actually a city-of-my-youth song.

A new and instantly memorable ode to New York — a city that has had its share of them.

### 41. “Intro” — Davido

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LFiQJ24wZj0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Vibe for days.

Provides a perfect — and unplanned — segue to the next song on the list with these lyrics: “Jah be my savior *on God*” [emphasis mine].

### 40. “On God” — Kanye West

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JebdwWSlzSo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Not a fan of Kanye’s latest. Not saying it’s gimmickry or anything. For me, a Christian, the content isn’t the problem; it’s the quality of the music that has dropped off.

But “On God” is a banger. What a beat.

### 39. “Let It All Out” — COIN

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pPYhGRaDtO0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Catharsis in audible form.

A song borne out of those moments where, for an instant, everything feels almost too magical for words.

### 38. “All Over Again” — MRVLZ

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oc4nMKe82po" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Sparkling chorus. Gorgeous production. I adore pop EDM standouts like “All Over Again.”

### 37. “Me Denny & Darryl” — Ghostface Killah (feat. Cappadonna and Method Man)

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUt3rqgwdfY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Beat is vintage Wu. All three verses are flames. Cappadonna is usually iffy, so, good to get a strong showing from him.

I mean, “I love rice and shrimp/If I can’t catch the plane then I’m catchin’ the blimp” is just a sensational lyric.

### 36. “Heat Wave” — The Hecks

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0NCBOtuDpng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Best Cars song by a group not named The Cars.

### 35. “Bang” — Griselda (feat Eminem)

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQjz7eszxyA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

This is a bit of a strange mashup. Griselda is a recovery of Mobb Deep era New York grime rap. Eminem is…not that. Yet the latter takes the opportunity to give us an ode to battle rap. So it works.

### 34. “Higher Beams” — The New Pornographers

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjNo-pePgHE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

A.C. Newman is usually good for at least one absolutely fantastic song per release. This is that song on TNP’s latest.

### 33. “IDK Why” — Gunna

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAZ3VAhZlPE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Gunna’s best quality is his ability to effortlessly provide a song’s best musical layer via rapping deliveries custom built for the particular track he’s on. In the hands of most other rappers, this would’ve turned out rather ordinary. Gunna gives it shape through his approach on the beat. Superb.
> All I know is grind

Yup.

### 32. “The End” — MisterWives

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qowkliVBvpg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

This one’s all about the chorus. Just lovely.

Plus, any band signed to a label called Fueled By Ramen is a-okay in my book.

### 31. “Capacity” — Charly Bliss

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3yayHHmUxs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Melodic pop perfection. Deceptively complex song profile; has multiple layers. Just what you’d expect from high-level power pop.

### 30. “What’s the Move” — Young Thug (feat. Lil Uzi Vert)

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXSfXcLeOps" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
> My jeans so tight they can’t fit

Who among us has a hard time relating to that?

Honestly, Young Thug’s rapping defies categorization. On “What’s the Move,” he turns out a more conventional performance. As if he didn’t want to mess with what he already had: a really, really good radio rap song with a high-level feature.

### 29. “Sun Queen” — Gerry Cinnamon

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QzfDumtXW48" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

A beautiful song from the Scottish singer-songwriter.
> She said she had a thing for James Dean
> And the music from the fifties
> When they used to keep the streets clean
> Faded memories of a young teen
> Like the echo of an old dream
> I carved her name into a sunbeam
> Cause she’s my sun queen

### 28. “Feel Something” — Clairo

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3AmOMH-pSAg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

The production is simultaneously minimalist and complex. Singing is gorgeous. The verse structure surpasses the chorus, which makes it a shame it was only given one go-round.

### 27. “Black Bull” — Foals

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PXTmNLRfkGM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

A rock and roll hurricane. A punishing, guitar-shredding spectacle of distortion. Inject it right into your veins and go Hulk the hell out on your enemies.

### 26. “Middle Child” — J. Cole

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WILNIXZr2oc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

J. Cole’s a far better rapper than he is a songwriter. He’ll kill verses but underwhelm on hooks.

But “Middle Child” is the total package.

### 25. “Please Won’t Please” — Helado Negro

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HaOfenje23Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

There’s a fragile power to Helado Negro’s music. “Please Won’t Please” is so movingly delicate it nearly cracks. Beautiful.

### 24. “I Forgot That You Existed” — Taylor Swift

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1cEvNn88jM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

The production is sublime, like the album title track and like the album cover itself. Its ethereal quality actually belies the earned viciousness of the message.

That’s when you know closure has come. When the former flame no longer even registers.

### 23. “Sin Pensar” — Ozuna (feat. Swae Lee)

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MB2E7mpi1Go" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Spanglish anthem. Swae Lee is consistently one of the best guest features in the game.

### 22. “Official” — Charli XCX

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W8gIH2fZhNk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Charli’s first of three appearances on this list. And it comes at #22, so that should tell you something about how I rate her output this year.

To think, she almost dropped this track from the album. Her producer had to convince her to keep. Would have been unforgivable to shave away a song this dreamy.

### 21. “Get a Bag” — Chance the Rapper (feat. Calboy)

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/68DZ1EL4Vp8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

As melodic as any peak era Bone Thugs song — but far more wholesome (which is not necessarily better). Excellent hook and guest spot.

### 20. “Stepdad” — Alex Cameron

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DN4wtJT050I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

I love this song. I love the organ-ey feel. The lyrics. The chorus.
> I could put you to sleep just by reading
> Turn the living room into an avalanche
> I loved to make you laugh …
> I’m your stepdad

### 19. “The Borders” — Sam Fender

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j2EKkWl7K1A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Wouldn’t be out of place as a top track on a Springsteen album. Which is one of the best compliments I can give it.

### 18. “1999” — Hovvdy

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1pLmZIJ_pEU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

The nostalgic power of an ode to a small town childhood.

### 17. “Hey, Ma” — Bon Iver

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDAKS18Gv1U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Bon Iver’s latest album underwhelmed. A couple cycles back, he was arguably my artist of the year, with two songs in the Top 10.

Though I started out liking the album fine — with songs like “U (Man Like)” and “iMi” — I grew to think the melodies weren’t worked on enough. “Hey, Ma,” on the other hand, is richly rewarding.

### 16. “Die Waiting” — Beck (feat. Sky Ferreira)

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mg_eVLT3JyM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Well, what do you know: a bit of pop excellence from one the genre’s greatest innovators.

Beck’s melodic quality is severely underrated.

### 15. “Cash War” — Gunna

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lfw2MyGMxcc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

I tweeted this in August:

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/2f2e7f3399390e78431702f2e2368e89" frameborder=0></iframe>

I stand by that assessment.

### 14. “Click” — Charli XCX (feat. Kim Petras and Tommy Cash)

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nK3mbxs7IOU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

It’s hard to describe “Click.” Not because the sounds don’t come together well enough to give it a coherent shape, but because it’s Charli at her futuristic best. And so we don’t have ready-made terms for what we’re hearing. The glitches and metallic bursts combine to form a sort of warehouse industrial pop. It helps that Kim Petras and Tommy Cash absolutely wreck their guest appearances.

### 13. “Brothers + Sisters” — Floorplan

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ZywjgfcFcM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

About as good as House music gets.

### 12. “Love Goes On” — Hannah Diamond

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uo0pM2iJmY8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Shines and shimmers. Dream pop par excellence.

The auto-tuned intonations carry a rather simple melody quite far.

### 11. “Friend of Mine” — Whitney

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/24xud8PlbyE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

The first of two Whitney appearances on this list. The album left a lot to be desired, but the two tracks that make the Top 11 are, to me, simply magical. This is ’70s era AM folkpop — and it is one of the loveliest things you’ll hear all year.

### 10. “Sunflower” — Post Malone and Swae Lee

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ApXoWvfEYVU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

The zenith of sing-songy pop rap. Post Malone was built for tracks like this. A short but sweet pop masterpiece.

### 9. “Hot” (Remix) — Young Thug (feat. Gunna and Travis Scott)

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/leJNDpm_G10" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

This is Young Thug at his best. He starts with a literal mumble rap intro into his verse, and then flashes four of the greatest adlibs of his career. In a row. I don’t know how Travis Scott wasn’t on this song originally — it’s basically tailor-made for him. The beat is sublime.

### 8. “Sudbury” — Hovvdy

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HN5vwWfNmZE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

There is a lot of meaning packed into Hovvdy songs. Not in a The Future Makes Sense sort of way; but in a The Past Was Wonderful way.

The past is where you reacquaint yourself with the longings and yearnings of what you once thought life could someday be. In the singer’s case: dreams of baseball superstardom. I don’t know if nostalgia can ever really be anything but haunting, in the end, but there is a kind of optimism that shines through here.

### 7. “It’s Nice To Have A Friend” — Taylor Swift

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eaP1VswBF28" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

The sweetness of being in love not just with someone you’re attracted to but someone you’re genuinely friends with.
> Church bells ring, carry me home
> Rice on the ground looks like snow
> Call my bluff, call you “babe”
> Have my back, yeah, everyday

### 6. “Will We Talk” — Sam Fender

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vafuj8S9rFk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Sam Fender’s “Will We Talk” dropped in the middle of the summer like a gem from a long-left-behind era in pop rock. The kind of music that the “When You Were Young” era Killers should have been able to produce, but never did.

### 5. “Bad Man” — (Sandy) Alex G

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbrJ9BXOvqU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

One of the most creative pop fusionists is also, quietly, one of its best songwriters.

This is equal parts pop, Americana, folk…you name it. It’s also beautiful.

### 4. “Stay High” — Brittany Howard

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CfizQsGWOxI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Brittany Howard’s “Stay High” is so soulful, the vocals are so dreamy, that only Terry Crews could have been pegged to lip-sync it in the official video.

This is just about the highest plane a song can reach. Absolutely sublime.

### 3. “If You Think It’s Love” — King Princess

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4VH7VcJuNqk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

There is nothing complicated about this song. Its power comes from a single phrase, sung over and over, with slight variations each time: “If you think it’s love, it is.” The production is perfect because of the way the vocals get layered.

This is the second year in a row that a King Princess song is among the three best songs of the year. What an artist.

### 2. “Valleys (My Love)” — Whitney

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VRBr8CZkzVg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

It was hard for me to put this at #2 as opposed to in the top slot. This is an absolute diamond from Whitney.

They capture, more than any other band, the dirt road glory of heart-achingly powerful country soul. Just sparkling in its easygoing beauty.

### 1. “Next Level Charli” — Charli XCX

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8mhfE_vzwjo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

“Next Level Charli” is the singer’s anthem about her own fans. She imagines what the ideal “Angel” (as her most devoted fans are known) is up to, and sings about it. The apogee of fan service, yet it doesn’t feel at all like pandering.
> I go hard, I go fast
And I never look back
I go speeding on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash
Turn the volume up in the party
Put your hands up and dance
Bump bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever
> And bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speeding on the highway
Flame burning, tire screams
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump bump, lights go out
Go forever and ever
> And drop body high
Blue and pink like the sky
I go speeding on the highway
Vroom vroomming, might die
Turn the volume up in your Prius
Windows down and just vibe
Bump bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever
> And roll with your friends out ’til 7AM
Come and meet me on the highway
Smoke blowing, let’s race
Turn the volume up on the speakers
Got that look on your face
Bump bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever

You get the idea.

But what’s most special about it is that it’s a perfect pop song.

There you have it. Another year in the books. May the next decade bring even more musical joy.
