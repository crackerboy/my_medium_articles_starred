## **Overview**

ReplicationController *a.k.a **rc** *ensures that specified number of pods are running all the time in the cluster *.*If there are more number of pods they will be killed and vice-versa. Pods will be replaced automatically if they are maintained by a Replication Controller in case of any crash/failure, deletion or termination. *Labels* associate replication controllers with the pods.

Common Usage patterns of ReplicationController are Rolling Upgrades,Re-Scheduling ,Scale-up and down based on application load.

**Deploying a Sample *ReplicationController***

In this example , we will deploy a sample ***hellowhale*** application through ReplicationController. It‚Äôs a simple web app displaying the official docker Blue Whale image.

Replication controller will typically contain 3 main items ***kind,metadata and spec*** . Kind specifies the kind of the object that is getting created, here in this case it‚Äôs ***ReplicationController**.* Metadata specifies the name of the object(i.e. hellowhale-rc) . Spec will specifies the number of replicas(i.e. 3 in our example) and the pod specification under template.

As stated above ReplicationController will be associated with the pods through labels and selectors ( i.e. hellowhale-app in our example).

***ReplicationController Deployment on Kubernetes Cluster***

Ensure we have minikube cluster or any GKE cluster up and running.

![**Describe the ReplicationController Status**](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2092/1*CpKyRjACJZOXUWiGPCuHBg.png)***Describe the ReplicationController Status***

Describe command shows the current status of the ReplicationController and Pod Status -i.e. Name,Age, Current Status , Selector and Labels used.

Access the pods using NodePort Service.

Access the homepage from browser using the nodeip which is Minikube IP Address( 192.168.99.100) and the NodePort(31111) as defined and exposed through the service.

Let‚Äôs try to scale-up and down the pods using the ReplicationController. 3 pods are scaled to 5 instances now.

Delete & Clean the entire setup
