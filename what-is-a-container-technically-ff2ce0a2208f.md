# What is a container, technically?

Containers are Linux Processes with additional configuration added. Let‚Äôs take a look at it from technical perspective:

![The Docker container launches a process called redis-server.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*YXC6yWUtF_RGA71OxJkUhA.jpeg)*The Docker container launches a process called redis-server.*

As you can see from Linux perspective, these are standard processes and have the same properties as other processes on our system.
