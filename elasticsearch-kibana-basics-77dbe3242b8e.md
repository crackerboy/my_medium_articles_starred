# ElasticSearch+Kibana basics.



## Overview

In this article, we‚Äôre going to focus on two parts of ELK stack ‚Äî ElasticSearch and Kibana.

ElasticSearch is a distributed analytics and full search engine, highly scalable and easy to use.
ES is open source, RESTful and JSON-based. It can help you manage the huge amount of data, which is why it is so common in the Big Data world.
ElasticSearch is used by such companies as Netflix, Stack Overflow, LinkedIn, etc.
Kibana is an analytic and visualization platform that has a tight integration with ElasticSearch, but we will use only Kibana‚Äôs Console to create, update, search and view the data stored in Elasticsearch indices.

## Get started

Docker commands for starting Elasticsearch and Kibana.

docker pull nshou/elasticsearch-kibana docker run -d -p 9200:9200 -p 5601:5601 nshou/elasticsearch-kibana

After a few minutes you can access to Kibana [here](http://localhost:5601)
Then go to Console, which can be found in Dev Tools(just click on the tiny spanner on the left) and let‚Äôs create an index.

## Creating an index ‚Äúbooks‚Äù.

Below you can see a query for creating an index ‚Äúbooks‚Äù with 15 documents, each of them has predefined id and 5 fields.

    POST /books/_bulk

    {"author": "Isaac Asimov", "genre": "science fiction", "title": "I, Robot", "pages": 224, "description": "The three laws of Robotics:\n1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\nWith these three, simple directives, Isaac Asimov changed our perception of robots forever when he formulated the laws governing their behavior. In I, Robot, Asimov chronicles the development of the robot through a series of interlinked stories: from its primitive origins in the present to its ultimate perfection in the not-so-distant future--a future in which humanity itself may be rendered obsolete.\nHere are stories of robots gone mad, of mind-read robots, and robots with a sense of humor. Of robot politicians, and robots who secretly run the world--all told with the dramatic blend of science fact and science fiction that has become Asimovs trademark.", "created": "2019/09/17"}

To preserve knowledge and save mankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire -- both scientists and scholars -- and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the Galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for a future generations. He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.\nBut soon the fledgling Foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords rising in the wake of the receding Empire. Mankinds last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice: submit to the barbarians and be overrun -- or fight them and be destroyed.", "created": "2019/09/17"}

On the beautiful Outer World planet of Solaria, a handful of human colonists lead a hermit-like existence, their every need attended to by their faithful robot servants. To this strange and provocative planet comes Detective Elijah Baley, sent from the streets of New York with his positronic partner, the robot R. Daneel Olivaw, to solve an incredible murder that has rocked Solaria to its foundations. The victim had been so reclusive that he appeared to his associates only through holographic projection. Yet someone had gotten close enough to bludgeon him to death while robots looked on. Now Baley and Olivaw are faced with two clear impossibilities: Either the Solarian was killed by one of his robots - unthinkable under the laws of Robotics - or he was killed by the woman who loved him so much that she never came into his presence!", "created": "2019/09/17"}

The adventures Sasha has in the largely dysfunctional Institute involve all sorts of magical beings and devices-a wish-granting fish, a talking cat who can remember only the beginnings of stories, a sofa that translates fairy tales into reality, a motorcycle that can zoom into the imagined future, a hungry dog-size mosquito-along with a variety of wizards (including Merlin), vampires, and petty bureaucrats.", "created": "2019/09/17"}

Dumas transforms minor historical figures into larger- than-life characters: the Comte d‚ÄôArtagnan, an impetuous young man in pursuit of glory; the beguilingly evil seductress ‚ÄúMilady‚Äù; the powerful and devious Cardinal Richelieu; the weak King Louis XIII and his unhappy queen‚Äîand, of course, the three musketeers themselves, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, whose motto ‚Äúall for one, one for all‚Äù has come to epitomize devoted friendship.

We just created an index ‚Äúbooks‚Äù, that consists of 15 documents and fields: ‚Äúauthor‚Äù, ‚Äúgenre‚Äù, ‚Äútitle‚Äù, ‚Äú pages‚Äù, ‚Äú description‚Äù and ‚Äúcreated.
Once you are indexed documents and the index, ES automatically define fields and mapping types for them. It is called ‚Äúdynamic mapping‚Äù.
Let‚Äôs take a look how does the mapping created by ES look.

    GET /books/_mapping

    {
      "books" : {
        "mappings" : {
          "properties" : {
            "author" : {
              "type" : "text",
              "fields" : {
                "keyword" : {
                  "type" : "keyword",
                  "ignore_above" : 256
                }
              }
            },
            "created" : {
              "type" : "date",
              "format" : "yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss||yyyy/MM/dd||epoch_millis"
            },
            "description" : {
              "type" : "text",
              "fields" : {
                "keyword" : {
                  "type" : "keyword",
                  "ignore_above" : 256
                }
              }
            },
            "genre" : {
              "type" : "text",
              "fields" : {
                "keyword" : {
                  "type" : "keyword",
                  "ignore_above" : 256
                }
              }
            },
            "pages" : {
              "type" : "long"
            },
            "title" : {
              "type" : "text",
              "fields" : {
                "keyword" : {
                  "type" : "keyword",
                  "ignore_above" : 256
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

The dynamic mapping for text fields make them text and keyword by default. ‚Äútype‚Äù : ‚Äútext‚Äù, ‚Äúfields‚Äù : { ‚Äúkeyword‚Äù : { ‚Äútype‚Äù : ‚Äúkeyword‚Äù, ‚Äúignore_above‚Äù : 256 } } That makes possible to perform full-text search these fields, and keyword search and aggregations using the FIELD_NAME.keyword field.

## Creating an index, with specified mapping.

If the dynamic mapping doesn‚Äôt satisfy you, you can explicit it by yourself.
Let‚Äôs delete an index.

    DELETE books

And recreate it with defining a mapping.

    PUT /books
    {
      "mappings": {
          "dynamic": false,
          "properties": {
            "added": {
              "type": "date",
              "format": "year_month_day"
            },
            "author": {
              "type": "keyword"
            },
            "description": {
              "type": "text",
              "analyzer": "my_custom_analyzer"
            },
            "genre": {
              "type": "text"
            },
            "pages": {
              "type": "integer"
            },
            "title": {
              "type": "keyword"
            }
        }
      }
    }

We just have created a mapping for index ‚Äúbooks‚Äù Where we set ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù to false , that means that dynamical adding fields to document will be disabled. In properties we defined our fields and their types. Field ‚Äúadded‚Äù with type ‚Äúdate‚Äù and ‚Äúformat‚Äù ‚Äî ‚Äúformat‚Äù: ‚Äúyear_month_day‚Äù. This means, that in field ‚Äúadded‚Äù we can put the date in format ‚Äúyear/month/day‚Äù. Also we created the mapping for fields ‚Äúauthor, ‚Äúgenre‚Äù and ‚Äútitle‚Äù , ‚Äúdescription‚Äù with type ‚Äútext‚Äù and ‚Äúpages‚Äù with type ‚Äúinteger‚Äù.

NOTE You can‚Äôt update a mapping, for already existing fields.

Now we can add the documents in the ‚Äúbooks‚Äù like we did it before.

    POST /books/_bulk 
    { ... }

## Adding a new field for an existing mapping

What if we decided to create a new field? For example, we want to add ‚Äúvolumes‚Äù into ‚ÄúThe Chronicles of Narnia‚Äù and maybe in other books too.
We still can do it.

    PUT /books/_mapping/
    {
      "properties": {
        "volumes": {
          "type": "keyword"
        }
      }
    }

We just added mapping for the new field ‚Äúvolumes‚Äù with type ‚Äútext‚Äù. By default in ES, you can put a zero or more objects in any type of field, so no need to specify array type for volumes here.

A query for updating the document with id = 15, that contain ‚ÄúThe Chronicles of Narnia‚Äù.

    POST /books/_doc/15
    {
      "volumes": ["The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", "Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia",  "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader", "The Silver Chair", "The Horse and His Boy", "The Magician's Nephew", "The Last Battle"]
    }

Let‚Äôs take a look at an updated document.

    GET /books/_doc/15

Here is a result of our query.

    {
      "_index" : "books",
      "_type" : "_doc",
      "_id" : "15",
      "_version" : 2,
      "_seq_no" : 15,
      "_primary_term" : 1,
      "found" : true,
      "_source" : {
        "volumes" : [
          "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe",
          "Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia",
          "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader",
          "The Silver Chair",
          "The Horse and His Boy",
          "The Magician's Nephew",
          "The Last Battle"
        ]
      }
    }

## Analyzers

Analyzer in ES consists of 3 parts: character filter, tokenizer and token filter.
When you add a character filter it receives the original text as a stream of characters and then can transform it by removing, adding or changing characters. A tokenizer receives a stream of characters, breaks it up into individual tokens (usually individual words), and outputs a stream of tokens. So if we have a sentence consisting of 5 words, tokenizer will break it up to 5 individual words.
Token filters receive a stream of tokens and then modify them, delete or add.

ElasticSearch has a wide selection of built-in analyzers, which can be used without any configurations. You can found them [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-analyzers.html) 
Also, you can create a custom analyzer choosing from the variety of built-in character filters, tokenizers, and token filters.

### Configuring a standard analyzer.

    PUT /books
    {
      "settings": {
        "analysis": {
          "analyzer": {
            "english_analyzer": {
              "type": "standard",
              "stopwords": "_english_"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

Let‚Äôs use our analyzer.

    POST /books/_analyze
    {
      "analyzer": "english_analyzer",
      "text": "If you don‚Äôt like to read, you haven‚Äôt found the right book. ‚Äì J.K. Rowling"
    }

In ‚Äúanalyzer‚Äù we‚Äôre specifying the name of configuring earlier analyzer and in ‚Äútext‚Äù ‚Äî text that we want to analyze.

### Configuring a custom analyzer.

For custom analyzer we should specify character filters, tokenizers and token filters it will consist of.

    PUT /books
    {
      "settings": {
        "analysis": {
          "analyzer": {
            "my_custom_analyzer": {
              "type": "custom",
              "char_filter": ["html_strip"],
              "tokenizer": "whitespace",
              "filter": ["uppercase", "unique"]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

We just created a custom analyzer, by specifying it‚Äôs ‚Äútype‚Äù as ‚Äúcustom‚Äù. This analyzer has a character filter ‚Äúhtml_strip‚Äù, that strips HTML elements from the text and replaces HTML character codes with their decoded value. ‚Äúwhitespace‚Äù tokenizer breaks the text into terms whenever a whitespace character will be found. ‚Äúuppercase‚Äù token filter will normalize text to uppercase and ‚Äúunique‚Äù will be index only unique tokens during analysis.

Let‚Äôs use our analyzer on a simple example and see how it works.

    POST /analyzers_test/_analyze
    {
    "analyzer": "my_custom_analyzer", 
      "text": "<html>If you don&apos;t like to read, you haven&apos;t found the <h3>right book</h3>. ‚Äì J.K. Rowling</html>"
    }

      ]
    }

Our result looks like expected. The sentence is split up correctly, all our terms are in uppercase, we see the word ‚ÄúYOU‚Äù only once, and instead of HTML character code &apos; we see it's decoded value '.
Suchwise you can customize your analyzer using different built-in tokenizers, character filters and token filters. But where are the results of the analysis stored? They're stored in the special data structure, that is called inverted index. An inverted index consists of the list of all the unique words that appear in any document, and for each word, a list of the documents in which it appears. An inverted index is created for each text field in the document.

In the mapping for the ‚Äúbooks‚Äù index, we have created 4 ‚Äútext‚Äù fields: ‚Äúauthor‚Äù, ‚Äúdescription‚Äù, ‚Äúgenre‚Äù and ‚Äútitle‚Äù. Also, we added a mapping for ‚Äúvolumes‚Äù, which is of the type ‚Äútext‚Äù too, therefore 5 inverted indices should be created.

Inverted indices allow very officiant and fast full-text searches.

## Searching

### URI search

For creating a URI search query we specify

GET NAME_OF_INDEX/_search?q=OUR_QUERY

For example, this is how a request for searching all documents in index ‚Äúbooks‚Äù looks:

    GET /books/_search?q=*

Let‚Äôs also create a request for searching by specific field (q=NAME_OF_FIELD:VALUE)

    GET /books/_search?q=author:Isaac Asimov

Search request by the field ‚Äúauthor‚Äù, which should contain ‚ÄúIsaac Asimov‚Äù

    GET /books/_search?q=genre:science fiction

Search request by the field ‚Äúgenre‚Äù, which should contain ‚Äúscience fiction‚Äù Also, we can create a searching query using boolean logic.

    GET /books/_search?q=genre:science fiction AND author:Isaac Asimov

This query will search for documents with ‚Äúgenre‚Äù = ‚Äúscience fiction‚Äù and ‚Äúauthor‚Äù = ‚ÄúIsaac Asimov‚Äù

    GET /books/_search?q=author:Charlotte Bront√´ OR author:Isaac Asimov

The result of this query will be all documents with author Charlotte Bront√´ and author Isaac Asimov.

    GET /books/_search/?size=5

The result of this query will be first 5 documents from the ‚Äúbooks‚Äù

You can find documentation [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.1/search-uri-request.html) if you want to learn more about URI search.

### Query DSL search with request body.

Structure of the DSL query with search body:

    GET /<NAME_OFINDEX>/_search { "query": { <PARAMETERS> } }

Let‚Äôs start from creating a query, that will search for all existing documents and return their amount and some of their values.

    GET /books/_search
    {
      "query": {
        "match_all": {
        }
      }
    }

This query is similar to GET /books/_search?q=* A search query, that will be searching for a specific value in the specific field:

    GET /books/_search
    {
      "query": {
        "match": {
          "genre": " ROMANCE NOVEL "
        }
      }
    }

‚Äúmatch‚Äù query is a part of ‚Äúfull text‚Äù queries. Full text queries are analyzed with "standard" analyzer before matching. That means that the text provided in the field "genre" will be broken into terms and lowercased. In our case, it will search for words "romance" and "novel" in the "inverted index". So how does that search work? Foremost will be searched for documents which contain two words "romance" and "novel", after that will be searched for all documents, that contain at least one of these words.

Let‚Äôs take a look at the result of the query:

    One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
    In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.
    From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.
    When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.

In the hits -> total -> value we can see how many documents satisfy our search query and in the "_score" of each document we can see how well it satisfies it. Therefore in the documents where both words matches we see "_score": 2.5876663, where only one("fantasy novel") we see "_score": 1.0678406. But what if we don't want results with only one matched word? What if we want to see documents that contain exactly "romance novel" genre? That sounds reasonable - let's create another query.

    GET /books/_search
    {
      "query": {
        "match": {
          "genre": {

          }
        }
      }
    }

By default, match query use Boolean operator ‚Äúor‚Äù, but now, when we have specified operator ‚Äúand‚Äù, all words from the query (‚Äúromance‚Äù and ‚Äúnovel‚Äù) must be present in the field ‚Äúgenre‚Äù. Result of this query looks like expected:

In its internalisation of the action ‚Äî the focus is on the gradual unfolding of Jane's moral and spiritual sensibility and all the events are coloured by a heightened intensity that was previously the domain of poetry ‚Äî Jane Eyre revolutionised the art of fiction.",

In some cases, we need a value of the field to match exactly to our query value. We can use ‚Äúmatch_prase‚Äù query for these needs.

    GET /books/_search
    {
      "query": {
        "match_phrase":{
          "title": "Gone with the wind"
         }
      }
    }

This query will search for the book, that exactly has a name ‚ÄúGone with the wind‚Äù.

    GET /books/_search
    {
      "query": {
        "multi_match":{
          "query": "robot",
          "fields": ["description", "title"]
         }
      }
    }

‚Äúmulti_match‚Äù query search for a given term in more than one field. In our case, we‚Äôre searching for the term ‚Äúrobot‚Äù in two fields: ‚Äúdescription‚Äù and ‚Äútitle‚Äù.

    GET /books/_search
    {
      "query": {
        "multi_match":{
          "query": "robot",
          "fields": ["description", "title"],
          "operator": "and"
         }
      }
    }

We can specify a boolean operator in the ‚Äúmulti_match‚Äù as well. The query above will search documents, that have words ‚Äúrobot‚Äù and ‚Äúdreams‚Äù in the ‚Äúdescription‚Äù or ‚Äútitle‚Äù field.

## Summary

Let‚Äôs summarize, what was done. We have created an index ‚Äúbooks‚Äù with dynamic mapping. Then we defined a mapping for our index manually. We saw how built-in ‚Äústandard‚Äù analyzer works and have configured a custom analyzer, using different built-in character filters, tokenizers, and token filters. Also, we got our hands dirty with URI searching and DSL search with the request body and tried different kinds of full text queries.
