## [**Security problems of Kops default deployments](https://medium.com/faun/security-problems-of-kops-default-deployments-2819c157bc90)**

by [Josselin Costanzi](undefined)
> We have all seen the [typical tutorial](https://blog.mrtrustor.net/post/k8s-aws-kops/) demonstrating how easy it is to deploy a Kubernetes Cluster on AWS using [Kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops). It’s almost a one-liner. In this article I’ll start from this one-liner and demonstrate several security flaws of the default deployment.
> Exploiting theses flaws gives an attacker full cluster control. This means that a single app compromise becomes a **full cluster compromise.**
> When thinking about security, you must think about [defense in depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)). The system must be conceived so that a breach somewhere can be contained. For a container management platform, this means that a breached container shouldn’t be able to access its host or other containers.
> In this article I’ll show that a default Kops setup has no security in depth and how an attacker can use a single compromised container to gain access to everything in the cluster. I’ll also show you how to handle and fix theses security flaws to the best of my knowledge.

## [**Istio step-by-step](https://medium.com/faun/istio-step-by-step-part-01-introduction-to-istio-b9fd0df30a9e), a 12-part series**

by [Nethmini Romina](undefined)
> Istio makes it easy to create a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more. Istio supports services by deploying a special sidecar proxy throughout the environment that intercepts all network communications between micro-services, then configure and manage Istio using **control plane **functionality which includes,
> Automatic load balancing for HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket and TCP traffic.
> *** gRPC — a modern open-source high-performance RPC framework that can run in any environment*
> Fine-grained control of traffic behaviour with rich routing rules, retries, failovers and fault injection
> A pluggable policy layer and configuration API supporting access controls, rate limits and quotas.
> Automatic metrics, logs and traces for all traffic within a cluster, including cluster ingress and egress.
> *** cluster ingress — a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach the cluster services.*
> *** cluster egress — a collection of rules that allow outbound connections to reach the cluster services.*
> Secure service-to-service communication in a cluster with strong identity-based authentication and authorization.

by [Brian Mathews](undefined)
> While container technology has existed for years, Docker really took it mainstream. A lot of companies and developers now use containers to ship their apps. Docker provides an easy to use interface to work with containers.
> However, for any non-trivial application, you will not be deploying “one container”, but rather a group of containers on multiple hosts.

by [ismail yenigül](undefined)
> Default Kubernetes service type is *clusterIP*, When you create a headless service by setting clusterIP *None*, no load-balancing is done and no cluster IP is allocated for this service. Only DNS is automatically configured. When you run a DNS query for headless service, you will get the list of the Pods IPs and usually client dns chooses the first DNS record.

## [Application Rollout Strategies — Kubernetes & Istio](https://medium.com/faun/application-rollout-strategies-kubernetes-istio-b1f58688ff30)

by [Gokul Chandra](undefined)
> As most modern software developers can attest, container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes have provided users with dramatically more flexibility for running cloud-native based applications as microservices on physical and virtual infrastructures. Sometimes deploying an application to all machines in the environment at once, it is better to deploy the application in batches. In production environments, reducing the downtime and risk while releasing newer versions becomes business critical. This is especially critical in production applications with live end-user traffic all the time like a website and related components which are critical to business, such as a e-commerce, banking or investment website.
> These applications almost always have frequent deployments. For example, a mobile application or an consumer web application may undergo several changes within a month. Some are even deployed to production multiple times a day. The speed at which you constantly update your application and deploy it’s new features to the users plays a significant role in maintaining consistence.
> Application deployment becomes more complicated the more the product grows. Deployment of a new application thus may mean deployment of new infrastructure code with it. A deployment strategy determines the deployment process, and is defined by the deployment configuration that a user provides while hosting the application on Kubernetes.

> We wanted to have some kind of distinctive way to connect these two worlds. Ballerina Kuburnetes annotation is the outcome of thinking out of the box to solve this problem. Ballerina is an open-source programming language optimized to write cloud-native applications such as microservice. It is intended to be the core of a language-centric middleware platform. It has all the general-purpose functionality expected of a modern programming language, but it also has several unusual aspects that make it particularly suitable for its intended purpose.

by [Carlos Vicens](undefined)
> All this started as a by-product of a meeting I had recently with a customer and also from a conversation I had with a partner. Both events triggered the need of managing configuration in a kubernetes namespace, and because I have been invo…
> Just to give you a bit of context…
> The meeting with the customer was focused on new Openshift features around Ops, and most of the time was spent on [Kubernetes Operators](https://operatorhub.io/what-is-an-operator), why, how, etc. In fact it was conducted as a lab where we used the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator), I’m referring to [this short lab](https://medium.com/devopslinks/using-the-operator-lifecycle-manager-to-deploy-prometheus-on-openshift-cd2f3abb3511). What is curious is that the relevant outcome of the meeting came from a side conversation about their CI/CD pipelines and specifically about configuration management… at that moment I thought what if we use an operator to ensure that configuration is as defined in the git repository.
> The conversation with the partner happened around the same week… again a side conversation (how important is wandering around every now and then ;-) this time it was about creating some kind of archetype to speed up the first moves of a new project forced me to develop the operator. The key concept of the side conversation was [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/), a new concept for me that fitted perfectly with the previous conversation about configuration management.
> So I decided to prove that this all made sense… and here’s the result.

## [How to Setup Scalable Jenkins on Kubernetes](https://medium.com/faun/how-to-setup-scalable-jenkins-on-kubernetes-f5c1b7d439cd)

by [Kasun Sameera](undefined)
> Why do we want to run Jenkins in kubernetes? That might be your first question. You might not find a requirement to run Jenkins in K8s strait away. When your codebase grows larger or run many jobs parallelly, Jenkins will grow very largely. This will slow down your builds and lead to unnecessary resource utilization. Let’s assume that you have 3 Jenkins slaves and each can run 3 job parallelly. Then you can run maximum 9 jobs parallelly, other jobs have to wait. Solution for these is scaling Jenkins.
> Scaling Jenkins is vey easy. Jenkins has scaling feature out-fo-the-box. Jenkins comes with master/slave mode. Master is responsible for maintaining jobs, users, configurations, scheduling jobs in slaves and etc… Slaves are Jenkins agents, their primary task is executing jobs scheduled by the master.
> Every one knows K8s is container orchestration platform. So I’m going to implement this solution in K8s using its features.

by [Scott Coulton](undefined)
> In this blog post, we will look at applying the basic security policies to our deployments within Kubernetes. We are going to only look at three security settings. These really don’t need a massive understanding of the underlying Linux security subsystems like AppArmor or SELinux but give the most bang for your buck when deploying your applications.
> This blog post assumes that you already have a Kubernetes cluster up and running. If not you can deploy one on in the cloud with[ aks ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/?WT.mc_id=medium-blog-sccoulto)or locally with [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/).

Both Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are important tools that are used to deploy containers inside a cluster. Kubernetes and Docker Swarm has many their prominent niche USPs and Pros in the field and they are here to stay. Though both of them have quite a different and unique way to meet the goals, at the end of the day their endpoint remains quite near.
