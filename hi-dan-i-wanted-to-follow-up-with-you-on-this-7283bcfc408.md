In the process of reading up on this I ran into the following posts, which might be useful to others interested in this topic:

A high level summary would be: the cbr0 bridge is created and attached to the eth0 physical nic, and for each pod a virtual ethernet interface is created in the podâ€™s namespace and attached to a tap interface created on the bridge.

Thanks again for reading and responding!
