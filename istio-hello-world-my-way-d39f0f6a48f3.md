# Istio “Hello World” my way

What is this repo?

This is a really simple application I wrote over holidays a year ago (12/17) that details my experiences and feedback with istio. To be clear, its a really, really basic NodeJS application that i used but more importantly, it covers the main sections of [Istio](https://istio.io/) that i was seeking to understand better (if even just as a helloworld).

I do know isito has the “[bookinfo](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/samples/bookinfo)” application but the best way i understand something is to rewrite sections and only those sections from the ground up.

* **3/30/19**: Updated for Istio 1.1

* **6/2/18: **Updated for Istio 0.8

* **8/1/18**: Updated for Istio 1.0.0!

* **11/15/18**: Istio 1.1 Prelimanary build release-1.1-20181115-09-15

* **1/10/19**: Reverted to Istio 1.0.5 (prelim was too unstable; addin a bunch of stuff about authorization, egress and internal loadbalancing)

## What i tested

* Basic istio Installation on Google Kubernetes Engine.

* Grafana

* Prometheus

* SourceGraph

* Jaeger

* Route Control

* Destination Rules

* Egress Policies

* Egress Gateway

* HttpFilters

* Authorization Policies

* Internal LoadBalancer (GCP)

* [Mixer Out of Process Authorization Adapter](https://github.com/salrashid123/istio_custom_auth_adapter)

* Access GCE MetadataServer

## What is the app you used?

NodeJS in a Dockerfile…something really minimal. You can find the entire source under the ‘nodeapp’ folder in this repo.

The endpoints on this app are as such:

* /: Does nothing; ([source](https://github.com/salrashid123/istio_helloworld/blob/master/nodeapp/app.js#L24))

* /varz: Returns all the environment variables on the current Pod ([source](https://github.com/salrashid123/istio_helloworld/blob/master/nodeapp/app.js#L33))

* /version: Returns just the "process.env.VER" variable that was set on the Deployment ([source](https://github.com/salrashid123/istio_helloworld/blob/master/nodeapp/app.js#L37))

* /backend: Return the nodename, pod name. Designed to only get called as if the applciation running is a 'backend' ([source](https://github.com/salrashid123/istio_helloworld/blob/master/nodeapp/app.js#L41))

* /hostz: Does a DNS SRV lookup for the 'backend' and makes an http call to its '/backend', endpoint ([source](https://github.com/salrashid123/istio_helloworld/blob/master/nodeapp/app.js#L45))

* /requestz: Makes an HTTP fetch for three external URLs (used to show egress rules) ([source](https://github.com/salrashid123/istio_helloworld/blob/master/nodeapp/app.js#L95))

* /headerz: Displays inbound headers ([source](https://github.com/salrashid123/istio_helloworld/blob/master/nodeapp/app.js#L115))

* /metadata: Access the GCP MetadataServer using hostname and link-local IP address ([source](https://github.com/salrashid123/istio_helloworld/blob/master/nodeapp/app.js#L125))

I build and uploaded this app to dockerhub at

    docker.io/salrashid123/istioinit:1
    docker.io/salrashid123/istioinit:2

(to simulate two release version of an app …yeah, theyr’e the same app but during deployment i set an env-var directly):

You’re also free to build and push these images directly:

    docker build  --build-arg VER=1 -t your_dockerhub_id/istioinit:1 .
    docker build  --build-arg VER=2 -t your_dockerhub_id/istioinit:2 .

    docker push your_dockerhub_id/istioinit:1
    docker push your_dockerhub_id/istioinit:2

To give you a sense of the differences between a regular GKE specification yaml vs. one modified for istio, you can compare:

* [all-istio.yaml](https://github.com/salrashid123/istio_helloworld/blob/master/all-istio.yaml) vs [all-gke.yaml](https://github.com/salrashid123/istio_helloworld/blob/master/all-gke.yaml) (review Ingress config, etc)

Lets get started

## Create a 1.10+ GKE Cluster and Bootstrap Istio

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/ae7db1f3d8bf2f1b38a5020fbb4e95ea" frameborder=0></iframe>

Wait maybe 2 to 3 minutes and make sure all the Deployments are live:

## Make sure the Istio installation is ready

Verify this step by makeing sure all the Deployments are Available.

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/a813470e45eee303a318e2b34cae7dd6" frameborder=0></iframe>

## Make sure an IP for the LoadBalancer is assigned:

Run

    kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
    
    export GATEWAY_IP=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service \
       istio-ingressgateway \
       -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
    
    echo $GATEWAY_IP

Note down the $GATEWAY_IP; we will use this later as the entrypoint into the helloworld app

## Setup some tunnels to each of the services:

Open up three new shell windows and type in one line into each:

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/6aa84b6382b8756452ae45f3a4fae89d" frameborder=0></iframe>

Open up a browser (three tabs) and go to:

* Kiali [http://localhost:20001/kiali](http://localhost:20001/kiali) (username: admin, password: mysecret)

* Grafana [http://localhost:3000/dashboard/db/istio-dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard/db/istio-dashboard)

* Jaeger [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686/)

## Deploy the sample application

The default all-istio.yaml runs:

Ingress with SSL

Deployments:

→ myapp-v1: 1 replica

→ myapp-v2: 1 replica

→ be-v1: 1 replicas

→ be-v2: 1 replicas

## Deploy the sample application

The default all-istio.yaml runs:

* Ingress with SSL

* Deployments:

+myapp-v1: 1 replica

+myapp-v2: 1 replica

+be-v1: 1 replicas

+ be-v2: 1 replicas

basically, a default frontend-backend scheme with one replicas for each v1 and v2 versions.
> *Note: the default yaml pulls and run my dockerhub image- feel free to change this if you want.*

    kubectl apply -f all-istio.yaml
    kubectl apply -f istio-lb-certs.yaml

    kubectl apply -f istio-ingress-gateway.yaml
    kubectl apply -f istio-ingress-ilbgateway.yaml

    kubectl apply -f istio-fev1-bev1.yaml

Wait until the deployments complete:

    $ kubectl get po,deployments,svc,ing

    deployment.extensions/myapp-v2   1         1         1            1           50s

    service/myapp        ClusterIP   10.0.7.114   <none>        8080/TCP   50s

Notice that each pod has two containers: one is from isto, the other is the applicaiton itself (this is because we have automatic sidecar injection enabled on the default namespace).

Also note that in all-istio.yaml we did not define an Ingress object though we've defined a TLS secret with a very specific metadata name: istio-ingressgateway-certs. That is a special name for a secret that is used by Istio to setup its own ingress gateway:

### Ingress Gateway Secret in 1.0.0+

Note the istio-ingress-gateway secret specifies the Ingress cert to use (the specific metadata name is special and is required)

    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      tls.crt: _redacted_
      tls.key: _redacted_
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: istio-ingressgateway-certs
      namespace: istio-system
    type: kubernetes.io/tls

Remember we’ve acquired the $GATEWAY_IP earlier:

    export GATEWAY_IP=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
    echo $GATEWAY_IP

## Send Traffic

This section shows basic user->frontend traffic and see the topology and telemetry in the Kiali and Grafana consoles:

### Frontend only

So…lets send traffic with the ip to the /versions on the frontend

    for i in {1..1000}; do curl -k  [https://$GATEWAY_IP/version;](https://$GATEWAY_IP/version;) sleep 1; done

You should see a sequence of 1’s indicating the version of the frontend you just hit

    111111111111111111111111111111111

(source: [/version](https://github.com/salrashid123/istio_helloworld/blob/master/nodeapp/app.js#L37) endpoint)

You should also see on kiali just traffic from ingress -> fe:v1

and in grafana:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3800/0*qjJvn3hZvP9Jug72.png)

### Frontend and Backend

Now the next step in th exercise:

to send requests to user-->frontend--> backend; we'll use the /hostz endpoint to do that. Remember, the /hostzendpoint takes a frontend request, sends it to the backend which inturn echos back the podName the backend runs as. The entire response is then returned to the user. This is just a way to show the which backend host processed the requests.

(note i’m using [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) utility to parse JSON)

    for i in {1..1000}; do curl -s -k [https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz](https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz) | \
        jq '.[0].body'; sleep 1; done

you should see output indicating traffic from the v1 backend verison: be-v1-*. Thats what we expect since our original rule sets defines only fe:v1 and be:v1 as valid targets.

    $ for i in {1..1000}; do curl -s -k [https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz](https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz) | jq '.[0].body'; sleep 1; done

    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"

Note both Kiali and Grafana shows both frontend and backend service telemetry and traffic to be:v1

## Route Control

This section details how to selectively send traffic to specific service versions and control traffic routing.

## Selective Traffic

In this sequence, we will setup a routecontrol to:

1. Send all traffic to myapp:v1.

1. traffic from myapp:v1 can only go to be:v2

Basically, this is a convoluted way to send traffic from fe:v1-> be:v2 even if all services and versions are running.

The yaml on istio-fev1-bev2.yaml would direct inbound traffic for myapp:v1 to go to be:v2 based on the sourceLabels:. The snippet for this config is:

    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: be-virtualservice
    spec:
      gateways:
      - mesh
      hosts:
      - be
      http:
      - match:
        - sourceLabels:
            app: myapp
            version: v1
        route:
        - destination:
            host: be
            subset: v2
          weight: 100
    ---
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: DestinationRule
    metadata:
      name: be-destination
    spec:
      host: be
      trafficPolicy:
        tls:
          mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL
        loadBalancer:
          simple: ROUND_ROBIN
      subsets:
      - name: v1
        labels:
          version: v1
      - name: v2
        labels:
          version: v2

So lets apply the config with kubectl:

    kubectl replace -f istio-fev1-bev2.yaml

After sending traffic, check which backend system was called by invoking /hostz endpoint on the frontend.

What the /hostz endpoint does is takes a users request to fe-* and targets any be-* that is valid. Since we only have fe-v1 instances running and the fact we setup a rule such that only traffic from fe:v1 can go to be:v2, all the traffic outbound for be-* must terminate at a be-v2:

    $ for i in {1..1000}; do curl -s -k [https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz](https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz) | jq '.[0].body'; sleep 1; done

    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"
    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"
    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"
    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"
    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"
    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"
    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"

and on the frontend version is always one.

    for i in {1..100}; do curl -k [https://$GATEWAY_IP/version;](https://$GATEWAY_IP/version;) sleep 1; done
    11111111111111111111111111111

Note the traffic to be-v1 is 0 while there is a non-zero traffic to be-v2 from fe-v1:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3826/0*1H5UjDft-jeRYMtH.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3806/0*KJjGzah3gPJZPpiq.png)

If we now overlay rules that direct traffic allow interleaved fe(v1|v2) -> be(v1|v2) we expect to see requests to both frontend v1 and backend

    kubectl replace -f istio-fev1v2-bev1v2.yaml

then frontend is both v1 and v2:

    for i in {1..1000}; do curl -k  [https://$GATEWAY_IP/version;](https://$GATEWAY_IP/version;)  sleep 1; done
    111211112122211121212211122211

and backend is responses comes from both be-v1 and be-v2

    $ for i in {1..1000}; do curl -s -k [https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz](https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz) | jq '.[0].body'; sleep 1; done

    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3808/0*R4-62t4amgNzEiIl.png)

## Route Path

Now lets setup a more selective route based on a specific path in the URI:

* The rule we’re defining is: “*First* route requests to myapp where path=/version to only go to the v1 set"...if there is no match, fall back to the default routes where you send 20% traffic to v1 and 80% traffic to v2

    ---
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: myapp-virtualservice
    spec:
      hosts:
      - "*"
      gateways:
      - my-gateway
      http:
      - match:
        - uri:
            exact: /version
        route:
        - destination:
            host: myapp
            subset: v1
      - route:
        - destination:
            host: myapp
            subset: v1
          weight: 20
        - destination:
            host: myapp
            subset: v2
          weight: 80

then apply

    kubectl replace -f istio-route-version-fev1-bev1v2.yaml

So check all requests to /version are fe:v1

    for i in {1..1000}; do curl -k  https://$GATEWAY_IP/version; sleep 1; done
    1111111111111111111

You may have noted how the route to any other endpoint other than /version destination is weighted split and not delcared round robin (eg:)

    - route:
        - destination:
            host: myapp
            subset: v1
          weight: 20
        - destination:
            host: myapp
            subset: v2
          weight: 80

Anyway, now lets edit rule to and change the prefix match to /xversion so the match *doesn't apply*. What we expect is a request to http://gateway_ip/version will go to v1 and v2 (since the path rule did not match and the split is the fallback rule.

    kubectl replace -f istio-route-version-fev1-bev1v2.yaml

Observe the version of the frontend you’re hitting:

    for i in {1..1000}; do curl -k  [https://$GATEWAY_IP/version;](https://$GATEWAY_IP/version;) sleep 1; done
    2121212222222222222221122212211222222222222222

What you’re seeing is myapp-v1 now getting about 20% of the traffic while myapp-v2 gets 80% because the previous rule doens't match.

Undo that change /xversion --> /version and reapply to baseline:

    kubectl replace -f istio-route-version-fev1-bev1v2.yaml

### Canary Deployments with VirtualService

You can use this traffic distribuion mechanism to run canary deployments between released versions. For example, a rule like the following will split the traffic between v1|v2 at 80/20 which you can use to gradually roll traffic over to v2 by applying new percentage weights.

    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: myapp-virtualservice
    spec:
      hosts:
      - "*"
      gateways:
      - my-gateway
      http:
      - route:
        - destination:
            host: myapp
            subset: v1
          weight: 80
        - destination:
            host: myapp
            subset: v2
          weight: 20

## Destination Rules

Lets configure Destination rules such that all traffic from myapp-v1 round-robins to both version of the backend.

First lets force all gateway requests to go to v1 only:

on istio-fev1-bev1v2.yaml:

    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: myapp-virtualservice
    spec:
      hosts:
      - "*"
      gateways:
      - my-gateway
      http:
      - route:
        - destination:
            host: myapp
            subset: v1

And where the backend trffic is split between be-v1 and be-v2 with a ROUND_ROBIN

    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: DestinationRule
    metadata:
      name: be-destination
    spec:
      host: be
      trafficPolicy:
        tls:
          mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL
        loadBalancer:
          simple: ROUND_ROBIN
      subsets:
      - name: v1
        labels:
          version: v1
      - name: v2
        labels:
          version: v2

After you apply the rule,

    kubectl replace -f istio-fev1-bev1v2.yaml

you’ll see frontend request all going to fe-v1

    for i in {1..1000}; do curl -k  [https://$GATEWAY_IP/version;](https://$GATEWAY_IP/version;) sleep 1; done
    11111111111111

with backend requests coming from *pretty much* round robin

    $ for i in {1..1000}; do curl -s -k [https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz](https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz) | jq '.[0].body'; sleep 1; done

    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"
    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"

Now change the istio-fev1-bev1v2.yaml to RANDOM and see response is from v1 and v2 random:

    $ for i in {1..1000}; do curl -s -k [https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz](https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz) | jq '.[0].body'; sleep 1; done

    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"
    "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]"
    "pod: [be-v1-7c9c9d9bb7-s8pgz]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-rg9g]"

## Internal LoadBalancer

The configuration here sets up an internal loadbalancer on GCP to access an exposed istio service.

The config settings that enabled this during istio initialization is

    --set gateways.istio-ilbgateway.enabled=true

and in this tutorial, applied as a Service with:

    kubectl apply -f istio-ilbgateway-service.yaml

The yaml above specifies the exposed port forwarding to the service. In our case, the exported port is https-> :443:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: istio-ilbgateway
      namespace: istio-system
      annotations:
        cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: "internal"
      labels:
        chart: gateways
        heritage: Tiller
        release: istio
        app: istio-ilbgateway
        istio: ilbgateway
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
      selector:
        app: istio-ilbgateway
        istio: ilbgateway
      ports:
        -
          name: grpc-pilot-mtls
          port: 15011
        -
          name: grpc-pilot
          port: 15010
        -
          name: tcp-citadel-grpc-tls
          port: 8060
          targetPort: 8060
        -
          name: tcp-dns
          port: 5353

        -
          name: https
          port: 443

( the other entries exposing ports (grpc-pilot-mtls, grpc-pilot) are uses for expansion and for this example, can be removed).

We also defined an ILB Gateway earlier in all-istio.yaml as:

    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: Gateway
    metadata:
      name: my-gateway-ilb
    spec:
      selector:
        istio: ilbgateway
      servers:
      - port:
          number: 80
          name: http
          protocol: HTTP  
        hosts:
        - "*"
      - port:
          number: 443
          name: https
          protocol: HTTPS
        hosts:
        - "*"    
        tls:
          mode: SIMPLE
          serverCertificate: /etc/istio/ilbgateway-certs/tls.crt
          privateKey: /etc/istio/ilbgateway-certs/tls.key

As was VirtualService that specifies the valid inbound gateways that can connect to our service. This configuration was defined when we applied istio-fev1-bev1.yaml:

    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: myapp-virtualservice
    spec:
      hosts:
      - "*"
      gateways:
      - my-gateway
      - my-gateway-ilb  
      http:
      - route:
        - destination:
            host: myapp
            subset: v1
          weight: 100

Note the gateways: entry in the VirtualService includes my-gateway-ilb which is what defines host:myapp, subset:v1 as a target for the ILB

    gateways:
      - my-gateway
      - my-gateway-ilb

As mentioned above, we had to *manually* specify the port the ILB will listen on for traffic inbound to this service. For this example, the ILB listens on :443 so we setup the Service with that port

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: istio-ilbgateway
      namespace: istio-system
      annotations:
        cloud.google.com/load-balancer-type: "internal"
    ...
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
      selector:
        app: istio-ilbgateway
        istio: ilbgateway
      ports:
        -
          name: https
          port: 443

Finally, the certficates Secret mounted at /etc/istio/ilbgateway-certs/ was specified this in the initial all-istio.yaml file:

    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      tls.crt: LS0tLS1CR...
      tls.key: LS0tLS1CR...
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: istio-ilbgateway-certs
      namespace: istio-system
    type: kubernetes.io/tls

Now that the service is setup, acquire the ILB IP allocated

    export ILB_GATEWAY_IP=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ilbgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
    echo $ILB_GATEWAY_IP

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*MNt8msh5cuWDJ3ry.png)

Then from a GCE VM in the same VPC, send some traffic over on the internal address

    you@gce-instance-1:~$ curl -vk [https://10.128.15.226/](https://10.128.15.226/)

    < HTTP/2 200 
    < x-powered-by: Express

    < 

    Hello from Express!

* The Kiali console should show traffic from both gateways (if you recently sent traffic in externally and internally):

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3506/0*sU1SQu7EJy5C5SU5.png)

## Egress Rules

By default, istio blocks the cluster from making outbound requests. There are several options to allow your service to connect externally:

* Egress Rules

* Egress Gateway

* Setting global.proxy.includeIPRanges

Egress rules prevent outbound calls from the server except with whiteliste addresses.

For example:

    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: ServiceEntry
    metadata:
      name: bbc-ext
    spec:
      hosts:
      - [www.bbc.com](http://www.bbc.com)
      ports:
      - number: 80
        name: http
        protocol: HTTP
      resolution: DNS
      location: MESH_EXTERNAL
    ---
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: ServiceEntry
    metadata:
      name: google-ext
    spec:
      hosts:
      - [www.google.com](http://www.google.com)
      ports:
      - number: 443
        name: https
        protocol: HTTPS
      resolution: DNS
      location: MESH_EXTERNAL
    ---
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: google-ext
    spec:
      hosts:
      - [www.google.com](http://www.google.com)
      tls:
      - match:
        - port: 443
          sni_hosts:
          - [www.google.com](http://www.google.com)
        route:
        - destination:
            host: [www.google.com](http://www.google.com)
            port:
              number: 443
          weight: 100

Allows only http://www.bbc.com/* and [https://www.google.com/*](https://www.google.com/*)

To test the default policies, the /requestz endpoint tries to fetch the following URLs:

    var urls = [
                    'https://www.google.com/robots.txt',
                    'http://www.bbc.com/robots.txt',
                    'http://www.google.com:443/robots.txt',
                    'https://www.cornell.edu/robots.txt',
                    'https://www.uwo.ca/robots.txt',
                    'http://www.yahoo.com/robots.txt'
        ]

First make sure there is an inbound rule already running:

    kubectl replace -f istio-fev1-bev1.yaml

* Without egress rule, requests will fail:

    curl -k -s  [https://$GATEWAY_IP/requestz](https://$GATEWAY_IP/requestz) | jq  '.'

gives

    [
      {
        "url": "https://www.google.com/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: Client network socket disconnected before secure TLS connection was established",
      },
      {
        "url": "http://www.google.com:443/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: read ECONNRESET",
      },
      {
        "url": "http://www.bbc.com/robots.txt",
        "body": "",
        "statusCode": 404
      },
      {
        "url": "https://www.cornell.edu/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: read ECONNRESET",
      },
      {
        "url": "https://www.uwo.ca/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: Client network socket disconnected before secure TLS connection was established",
      },
      {
        "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: Client network socket disconnected before secure TLS connection was established",
      },
      {
        "url": "http://www.yahoo.com:443/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: read ECONNRESET",
    ]
> *Note: the 404 response for the bbc.com entry is the actual denial rule from the istio-proxy*

then apply the egress policy which allows www.bbc.com:80 and [www.google.com:443](http://www.google.com:443)

    kubectl apply -f istio-egress-rule.yaml

gives

    curl -s -k [https://$GATEWAY_IP/requestz](https://$GATEWAY_IP/requestz) | jq  '.'

    [
      {
        "url": "https://www.google.com/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": 200
      },
      {
        "url": "http://www.google.com:443/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: read ECONNRESET",
      },
      {
        "url": "http://www.bbc.com/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": 200
      },
      {
        "url": "https://www.cornell.edu/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: read ECONNRESET",
      },
      {
        "url": "https://www.uwo.ca/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: read ECONNRESET",
      },
      {
        "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: read ECONNRESET",
      },
      {
        "url": "http://www.yahoo.com:443/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: read ECONNRESET",
    ]

Notice that only one of the hosts worked over SSL worked

## Egress Gateway

THe egress rule above initiates the proxied connection from each sidecar….but why not initiate the SSL connection from a set of bastion/egress gateways we already setup? THis is where the [Egress Gateway](https://istio.io/docs/examples/advanced-egress/egress-gateway/) configurations come up but inorder to use this: The following configuration will allow egress traffic for www.yahoo.com via the gateway. See [HTTPS Egress Gateway](https://istio.io/docs/examples/advanced-gateways/egress-gateway/#egress-gateway-for-https-traffic)

So.. lets revert the config we setup above

    kubectl delete -f istio-egress-rule.yaml

then lets apply the rule for the gateway:

    kubectl apply -f istio-egress-gateway.yaml

    curl -s -k [https://$GATEWAY_IP/requestz](https://$GATEWAY_IP/requestz) | jq  '.'

    [
      {
        "url": "https://www.google.com/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: read ECONNRESET",
      },
      {
        "url": "http://www.google.com:443/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: read ECONNRESET",
      },
      {
        "url": "http://www.bbc.com/robots.txt",
        "body": "",
        "statusCode": 404
      },
      {
        "url": "https://www.cornell.edu/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: read ECONNRESET",
      },
      {
        "url": "https://www.uwo.ca/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: read ECONNRESET",
      },
      {
        "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": 200    <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
      },
      {
        "url": "http://www.yahoo.com:443/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: read ECONNRESET",
        }
      }
    ]

Notice that only http request to yahoo succeeded on port :443. Needless to say, this is pretty unusable; you have to originate ssl traffic from the host system itself or bypass the IP ranges rquests

## TLS Origination for Egress Traffic

In this mode, traffic exits the pod unencrypted but gets proxied via the gateway for an https destination. For this to work, traffic must originate from the pod unencrypted but specify the port as an SSL prot. In current case, if you want to send traffic for https://www.yahoo.com/robots.txt, emit the request from the pod as http://www.yahoo.com:443/robots.txt. Note the traffic is http:// and the port is specified: :443

Ok, lets try it out, apply:

    kubectl apply -f istio-egress-gateway-tls-origin.yaml

Then notice just the last, unencrypted traffic to yahoo succeeds

    curl -s -k https://$GATEWAY_IP/requestz | jq  '.
    [
      {
        "url": "https://www.google.com/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: write EPROTO 140000773143424:error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version 
      },
      {
        "url": "http://www.google.com:443/robots.txt",
        "body": "",
        "statusCode": 404
      },
      {
        "url": "http://www.bbc.com/robots.txt",
        "body": "",
        "statusCode": 404
      },
      {
        "url": "https://www.cornell.edu/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: write EPROTO 140000773143424:error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version 
      },
      {
        "url": "https://www.uwo.ca/robots.txt",

      },
      {
        "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/robots.txt",
        "statusCode": {
          "name": "RequestError",
          "message": "Error: write EPROTO 140000773143424:error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version

        "body": "<!DOCTYPE html>\
        "statusCode": 502
      }
    ]

## Bypass Envoy entirely

You can also configure the global.proxy.includeIPRanges= variable to completely bypass the IP ranges for certain serivces. This setting is described under [Calling external services directly](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress/#calling-external-services-directly) and details the ranges that *should* get covered by the proxy. For GKE, you need to cover the subnets included and allocated:

The /metadata endpoint access the GCE metadata server and returns the current projectID. This endpoint makes three separate requests using the three formats I've see GCP client libraries use. (note: the hostnames are supposed to resolve to the link local IP address shown below)

    app.get('/metadata', (request, response) => {

      var resp_promises = []
      var urls = [
    'http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id', 
    'http://metadata/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id',
    'http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id'
     ]

So if you make an inital request, you’ll see 404 errors from Envoy since we did not setup any rules.

    [
      {
        "url": "http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id",
        "body": "",
        "statusCode": 404
      },
      {
        "url": "http://metadata/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id",
        "body": "",
        "statusCode": 404
      },
      {
        "url": "http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id",
        "body": "",
        "statusCode": 404
      }
    ]

So lets do just that:

    kubectl apply -f istio-egress-rule-metadata.yaml

Then what we see is are two of the three hosts succeed since the .yaml file did not define an entry for metadata

    [
      {
        "url": "http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id",
        "body": "mineral-minutia-820",
        "statusCode": 200
      },
      {
        "url": "http://metadata/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id",
        "body": "",
        "statusCode": 404
      },
      {
        "url": "http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id",
        "body": "mineral-minutia-820",
        "statusCode": 200
      }
    ]

Well, why didn’t we? The parser for the pilot did’t like it if we added in

    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: ServiceEntry
    metadata:
      name: metadata-ext
    spec:
      hosts:
      - metadata.google.internal
      - metadata
      - 169.254.169.254
      ports:
      - number: 80
        name: http
        protocol: HTTP
      resolution: DNS
      location: MESH_EXTERNAL

then

    $ kubectl apply -f istio-egress-rule-metadata.yaml

    Error from server: error when creating "istio-egress-rule-metadata.yaml": admission webhook "pilot.validation.istio.io" denied the request: configuration is invalid: invalid host metadata

Is that a problem? Maybe not…Most of the [google-auth libraries](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-python/blob/master/google/auth/compute_engine/_metadata.py#L35) uses the fully qualified hostname or IP address (it used to use just metadata so that wou've been a problem)

## LUA HTTPFilter

The following will setup a simple Request/Response LUA EnvoyFilter for the frontent myapp:

The settings below injects headers in both the request and response streams:

    kubectl apply -f istio-fev1-httpfilter.yaml

    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: EnvoyFilter
    metadata:
      name: http-lua
    spec:
      workloadLabels:
        app: myapp
        version: v1
      filters:
      - listenerMatch:
          portNumber: 9080
          listenerType: SIDECAR_INBOUND
        filterName: envoy.lua
        filterType: HTTP
        filterConfig:
          inlineCode: |
            function envoy_on_request(request_handle)
              request_handle:headers():add("foo", "bar")
            end
            function envoy_on_response(response_handle)
              response_handle:headers():add("foo2", "bar2")
            end

Note the response headers back to the caller (foo2:bar2) and the echo of the headers as received by the service *from*envoy (foo:bar)

    $ curl -vk  [https://$GATEWAY_IP/headerz](https://$GATEWAY_IP/headerz)

    > GET /headerz HTTP/2

## Authorization

The following steps is basically another walkthrough of the [Istio RBAC](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/security/role-based-access-control/).

### Enable Istio RBAC

First lets verify we can access the frontend:

    curl -vk [https://$GATEWAY_IP/version](https://$GATEWAY_IP/version)
    1

Since we haven’t defined rbac policies to enforce, it all works. The moment we enable global policies below:

    kubectl apply -f istio-rbac-config-ON.yaml

then

    curl -vk [https://$GATEWAY_IP/version](https://$GATEWAY_IP/version)

    < HTTP/2 403
    < content-length: 19
    < content-type: text/plain
    < date: Thu, 06 Dec 2018 23:13:32 GMT
    < server: istio-envoy
    < x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 6

    RBAC: access denied

Which means not even the default istio-system which itself holds the istio-ingresss service can access application target. Lets go about and give it access w/ a namespace policy for the istio-system access.

### NamespacePolicy

    kubectl apply -f istio-namespace-policy.yaml

then

    curl -vk [https://$GATEWAY_IP/version](https://$GATEWAY_IP/version)

    < HTTP/2 200
    < x-powered-by: Express
    < content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    < content-length: 1
    < etag: W/"1-xMpCOKC5I4INzFCab3WEmw"
    < date: Thu, 06 Dec 2018 23:16:36 GMT
    < x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 97
    < server: istio-envoy

    1

but access to the backend gives:

    curl -vk [https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz](https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz)

    < HTTP/2 200
    < x-powered-by: Express
    < content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    < content-length: 106
    < etag: W/"6a-dQwmR/853lXfaotkjDrU4w"
    < date: Thu, 06 Dec 2018 23:30:17 GMT
    < x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 52
    < server: istio-envoy
    

    [
      {
        "url": "http://be.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/backend",
        "body": "RBAC: access denied",
        "statusCode": 403
      }
    ]

This is because the namespace rule we setup allows the istio-sytem *and* default namespace access to any service that matches the label

    labels:
        app: myapp

but our backend has a label of

    selector:
        app: be

If you want to verify, just add that label (values: ["myapp", "be"]) to istio-namespace-policy.yaml and apply

Anyway, lets revert the namespace policy to allow access back again

    kubectl delete -f istio-namespace-policy.yaml

You should now just see RBAC: access denied while accessing any page

### ServiceLevel Access Control

Lets move on to [ServiceLevel Access Control](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/security/role-based-access-control/#service-level-access-control).

What this allows is more precise service->service selective access.

First lets give access for the ingress gateway access to the frontend:

    kubectl apply -f istio-myapp-policy.yaml

Wait maybe 30seconds and no you should again have access to the frontend.

    curl -v -k [https://$GATEWAY_IP/version](https://$GATEWAY_IP/version)

    < HTTP/2 200
    < x-powered-by: Express
    < content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    < content-length: 1
    < etag: W/"1-xMpCOKC5I4INzFCab3WEmw"
    < date: Thu, 06 Dec 2018 23:42:43 GMT
    < x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 8
    < server: istio-envoy
    1

but not the backend

    curl -v -k [https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz](https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz)

    < HTTP/2 200
    < x-powered-by: Express
    < content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    < content-length: 106
    < etag: W/"6a-dQwmR/853lXfaotkjDrU4w"
    < date: Thu, 06 Dec 2018 23:42:48 GMT
    < x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 27
    < server: istio-envoy

    [
      {
        "url": "http://be.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/backend",
        "body": "RBAC: access denied",
        "statusCode": 403
      }
    ]

ok, how do we get access back from myapp-->be...we'll add on another policy that allows the service account for the frontend myapp-sa access to the backend. Note, we setup the service account for the frontend back when we setup all-istio.yaml file:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: myapp-sa
    ---
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: myapp-v1
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: myapp
            version: v1
        spec:
          serviceAccountName: myapp-sa

So to allow myapp-sa access to be.default.svc.cluster.local, we need to apply a Role/RoleBinding as shown inistio-myapp-be-policy.yaml:

    apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
    kind: ServiceRole
    metadata:
      name: be-viewer
      namespace: default
    spec:
      rules:
      - services: ["be.default.svc.cluster.local"]
        methods: ["GET"]
    ---
    apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
    kind: ServiceRoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: bind-details-reviews
      namespace: default
    spec:
      subjects:
      - user: "cluster.local/ns/default/sa/myapp-sa"
      roleRef:
        kind: ServiceRole
        name: "be-viewer"

So lets apply this file:

    kubectl apply -f istio-myapp-be-policy.yaml

Now you should be able to access the backend fine:

    curl -v -k [https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz](https://$GATEWAY_IP/hostz)

    < HTTP/2 200 
    < x-powered-by: Express
    < content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    < content-length: 168
    < etag: W/"a8-+rQK5xf1qR07k9sBV9qawQ"
    < date: Fri, 22 Mar 2019 00:44:30 GMT
    < x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 33
    < foo2: bar2
    < server: istio-envoy

    [
      {
        "url": "http://be.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/backend",
        "body": "pod: [be-v2-6b47d48f6f-p8t5t]    node: [gke-cluster-1-default-pool-21eaedac-dn3f]",
        "statusCode": 200
      }
    ]

## Cleanup

The easiest way to clean up what you did here is to delete the GKE cluster!

    gcloud container clusters delete cluster-1

## Conclusion

The steps i outlined above is just a small set of what Istio has in store. I’ll keep updating this as it move towards 1.0 and subsequent releases.

If you find any are for improvements, please submit a comment or git issue in this [repo](https://github.com/salrashid123/istio_helloworld),.
