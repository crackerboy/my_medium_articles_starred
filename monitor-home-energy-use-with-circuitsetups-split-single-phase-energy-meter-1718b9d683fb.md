CircuitSetupâ€™s Split Single Phase Energy Meter allows you to monitor the energy use in your entire home in real-time, which would let you calculate how much money is being spent, and find any appliance that may be drawing too much power. The board can even be used to measure how much power house-equipped solar panels are producing at any given time.

The Split Single Energy Meter is outfitted with a Microchip ATM90E32AS three-phase meter IC and can sample two current channels, and one voltage channel. The board includes standard current transformer clips for sampling current and a built-in buck converter to power an ESP32/8266 for wireless monitoring.

Rounding out the boardâ€™s feature set is 2X IRQ interrupts/1 warning output, energy pulse output, zero crossing output, and SPI interface. The Split Single Phase Energy Meter has a measurement error of 0.1%, a dynamic range of 6000:1, a gain selection of up to 4X, voltage reference drift typical (ppm/Â°C): 6, and a 16-bit ADC resolution. The board is capable of calculating active power, reactive power, apparent power, power factor, frequency, and temperature.

On the software side, the board employs an EmonCMS-based app for real-time monitoring in graph form, and can also take advantage of ThingSpeak or similar platform depending on your preference. CircuitSetupâ€™s Split Single Phase Energy Meter is [now available for $39.99](https://circuitsetup.us/index.php/product/split-single-phase-real-time-whole-house-energy-meter-v1-2/) and will be [coming soon to Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/circuitsetup/split-single-phase-energy-meter). They even [offer optional add-ons](https://www.tindie.com/products/CircuitSetup/split-single-phase-whole-house-energy-meter/), such as 3.5mm CT connectors, soldered headers, and a pre-programmed ESP32 for additional costs.
