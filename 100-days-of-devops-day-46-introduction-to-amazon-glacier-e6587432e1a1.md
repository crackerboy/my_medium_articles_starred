# 100 Days of DevOps — Day 46-Introduction to Amazon Glacier

Welcome to Day 46 of 100 Days of DevOps, Focus for today is Amazon Glacier
> What is Amazon Glacier?

* *Data Archiving Solution*

* *It’s designed for infrequently accessed data (you may require that data later for business need or legal purpose)*

* *Long term storage solution for low cost*

* *99.999999999(11 9’s of durability)*
> Key Terms

* ***Archive:** Any object that you store in a Glacier or basic unit of storage in Glacier*

* ***Vault:** Vault is the container for storing archive.*

* ***Access Policy:** Determine who can and can’t access the data stored in the Vault. It also controls what action user can and can’t perform on the Vault. You can also create a Vault lock policy so that Vault can’t be altered.*

*Only a few Glacier operations supported by AWS Management Console*

* *Creating and Deleting Vault*

* *Creating and Managing Vault Policies*

*For the rest of the operation, you need to rely on the below methods*

> Data retrieval from Glacier

* *Expedited: 1–5 min(highest cost)*

* *Standard: 3–5 hour*

* *Bulk: 5–12 hour(lowest cost)*

## *Performance across the S3 Storage Classes*

* *Choose S3 Storage Class based on your requirement*

* *Quick Comparision between S3 and Glacier*

> Security with Amazon Glacier

* *Glacier access can be control using IAM*

* *Glacier encrypt your data using AES-256*

* *Glacier manages key for you*

*Go to the Glacier tab using AWS console [https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/glacier](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/glacier) → Create Vault*

* *Choose all the default options and create Vault*

* *Most of the time, I see people use LifeCycle Policies to move the object from S3 to a glacier.*
> *LifeCycle Management*

*Why do we need LifeCycle Management?*

* *To save cost*

* *In most of the cases, data which is generated by our application is relevant for us for the first 30 days and after that, we don’t access that data as frequently.*

*Reference:*
[**Transitioning Objects — Amazon Simple Storage Service**
*You can add rules in a lifecycle configuration to tell Amazon S3 to transition objects to another Amazon S3 storage…*docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html)

*LifeCycle object supports the following but I am going to enable just the required parameters*

* [*enabled](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/s3_bucket.html#enabled-1) — (Required) Specifies lifecycle rule status.*

* [*transition](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/s3_bucket.html#transition) - (Optional) Specifies a period in the object's transitions*

* *Here I am defining after 30 days move the objects to STANDARD_IA and after 60 days to GLACIER.*

*Looking forward from you guys to join this journey and spend a minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days on DevOps work and post your progress using any of the below medium.*
