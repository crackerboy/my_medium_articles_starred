Humor, food, machine learning, crime, sports, and more

![Image by [AndSus](https://stock.adobe.com/contributor/200768506/andsus?load_type=author&prev_url=detail) on [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*qqSHCBs_v7FNLtzuc6y45g.jpeg)*Image by [AndSus](https://stock.adobe.com/contributor/200768506/andsus?load_type=author&prev_url=detail) on [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/)*

As a beginner developer, some of the first questions you‚Äôll ask yourself and others are:

* What projects should I work on as a beginner?

* What makes a good side project?

* Where should I start?

If you aren‚Äôt fond of the basic to-do list, calculator, or some type of clone answers, then the perfect place to start is by building interesting applications around public-facing REST APIs!

## What Is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. Don‚Äôt worry about the Application Programming part ‚Äî focus on ***Interface***. You use interfaces all the time. Your keyboard is an interface. An ATM. A search engine.

An interface sits on top of a complicated system and simplifies things for you, saving you from needing to know every complex detail of what‚Äôs under the hood. It‚Äôs a simple way to use smart things.

## What Is a REST API?

REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. Ultimately, you can think of them as a shortcut into a web service‚Äôs database. They provide a set of methods that a programmer can use via HTTP to send and receive data.

Companies won‚Äôt just let you log into their internal database and look around, but they will give you an easier way to access it in certain limited ways using their API. Some have limitations on the number of times you can call, some require signing up to receive a private API Key, and some require setting up OAuth for users to log in securely.

## This List

These APIs are ones I‚Äôve personally come across and thought were cool, fun, interesting, and different ‚Äî giving you an edge on your next project!

They are totally free, don‚Äôt require you to figure out how to handle OAuth, and are super easy to get started.

### Categories

These are the categories these APIs are under, in this order:

* **Animals (5)**

* **Anime (5)**

* **Art ( 5)**

* **Crime (5)**

* **Cryptocurrency (5)**

* **Drink (5)**
