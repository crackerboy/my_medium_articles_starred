# Decorating functions in Python

What is a high-order function?

In this post, I‚Äôll be explaining what Python decorators are and how you can implement one. Let‚Äôs get started!

## What is a decorator?

A decorator is no more than a comfortable way to call a high-order function. You‚Äôve probably seen it many many times already, it‚Äôs about those ‚Äú@dostuff‚Äù strings that you find from time to time above a function‚Äôs signature:

    @dostuff
    def foo():
      pass

Ok, but now, what is a high-order function? A high-order function is just any function that takes one (or more) function as an argument and/or returns a function. For instance, in the above example, ‚Äú@dostuff‚Äù would be the decorator, ‚Äúdostuff‚Äù would be the name of the high-order function and ‚Äúfoo‚Äù would be the decorated function and the parameter of the high-order function.

All clear? Great, let‚Äôs start implementing our first decorator!

## Building our first decorator

In order to start implementing our decorator, I‚Äôll introduce you to [functools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html): Python‚Äôs module for high-order functions. Specifically, we‚Äôre going to be using the [wraps](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.wraps) function.

Let‚Äôs create a high-order function that will print the execution time of the decorated function: we‚Äôll call it ‚Äútimeme‚Äù. In this way, every time we want to compute the execution time of a function, we‚Äôll just need to add the decorator ‚Äú@timeme‚Äù above the signature of the target method. Let‚Äôs start defining the signature of ‚Äútimeme‚Äù:

    def timeme(func):
      pass

As mentioned before, a high-order function takes another function (the decorated one) as its argument, so we‚Äôve included ‚Äúfunc‚Äù in its signature. Now, we need to add a wrapper function that will contain the timing logic. For this purpose, we‚Äôll be creating a ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù function that will be wrapped by functools‚Äô [wraps](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.wraps) function:

    from functools import wraps

    def timeme(func):
      @wraps(func)
      def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        pass

      return wrapper

Note that ‚Äútimeme‚Äù is returning the function ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù, which in turn, besides printing the execution time, will return the result of the decorated function.

Now, let‚Äôs complete the wrapper by implementing the timing logic:

    from functools import wraps
    import time

    def timeme(func):
      @wraps(func)
      def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Let's call our decorated function")
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print('Execution time: {} seconds'.format(time.time() - start))
        return result
      return wrapper

Note that the decorated function ‚Äúfunc‚Äù is being executed with its positional and keyword arguments. I‚Äôve added some print messages for you to observe the execution order. Alright! Let‚Äôs try it out, I‚Äôll create a simple function with a print message, decorated by ‚Äútimeme‚Äù:

    @timeme
    def decorated_func():
      print("Decorated func!")

If you run it, you will see something like the following:

    Let's call our decorated function
    Decorated func!
    Execution time: 4.792213439941406e-05 seconds

As you can see, the first print message was placed in the high-order function. Then, we are calling the decorated function and printing its own message. Finally, we compute the execution time and print it.
