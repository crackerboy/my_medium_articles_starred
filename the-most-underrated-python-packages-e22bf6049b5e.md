In my experience as a Python user, I’ve come across a lot of different packages and curated lists. Some are in my bookmarks like the great [awesome-python-data-science](https://github.com/krzjoa/awesome-python-data-science) curated list, or [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) curated list. If you don’t know them, go check them out asap.

In this post, I’d like to show you something else. These are the results of late-night GitHub/Reddit browsing, and cool stuff shared by colleagues.

Some of these packages are really unique, others are just fun to use and real underdogs among the data scientist/statistician I’ve worked with.
