# 100 Days of DevOpsâ€Šâ€”â€ŠDay 19 - Application Load Balancer using Terraform

Welcome to Day 19 of 100 Days of DevOps, Let continue our terraform journey and see how can we create Application Load Balancer using Terraform

*What is Application Load Balancer?*

*The **Application Load Balancer** is a feature of Elastic**Load** Balancing that allows a developer to configure and route incoming end-user traffic to **applications based** in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud.*

### Features

* *Layer7 load balancer(HTTP and HTTPs traffic)*

* *Support Path and Host-based routing(which let you route traffic to different target group)*

* *Listener support IPv6*

***Some Key Terms***

***Target Group***

***Target types:***

* *Instance types: Route traffic to the Primary Private IP address of that Instance*

* *IP: Route traffic to a specified IP address*

* *Lambda function*

***Health Check***

* *Determines whether to send traffic to a given instance*

* *Each instance must pass its a health check*

* *Sends HTTP GET request and looks for a specific response/success code*

*Reference: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html)*

***Step1:** Define the load balancer*

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/9f6ac9f7b6d627441b552c6f2278de07" frameborder=0></iframe>

    ***name:** The name of the LB. This name must be unique within your AWS account, can have a maximum of 32 characters, must contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphens, and must not begin or end with a hyphen. **If not specified, Terraform will autogenerate a name beginning with tf-lb (This part is important as Terraform auto
    **internal: If true, the LB will be internal.
    **load_balancer_type:** The type of load balancer to create. Possible values are **application** or **network**. The default value is **application**.
    **ip_address_type:** The type of IP addresses used by the subnets for your load balancer. The possible values are ipv4 and dualstack
    **subnets:** A list of subnet IDs to attach to the LB.In this case I am attaching two public subnets we created during load balancer creation
    **enable_deletion_protection:** If true, deletion of the load balancer will be disabled via the AWS API. This will prevent Terraform from deleting the load balancer. Defaults to false.
    **tags:** A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.*

***Step2:** Define the target group: This is going to provide a resource for use with Load Balancer.*

    ***health_check:** Your Application Load Balancer periodically sends requests to its registered targets to test their status. These tests are called health checks
    **interval:** The approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of an individual target. Minimum value 5 seconds, Maximum value 300 seconds. Default 30 seconds.
    **path:** The destination for the health check request
    protocol: The protocol to use to connect with the target. Defaults to HTTP
    **timeout:** The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response means a failed health check. For Application Load Balancers, the range is 2 to 60 seconds and the default is 5 seconds
    **healthy_threshold: **The number of consecutive health checks successes required before considering an unhealthy target healthy. Defaults to 3.
    **unhealthy_threshold:** The number of consecutive health check failures required before considering the target unhealthy
    **matcher:** The HTTP codes to use when checking for a successful response from a target. You can specify multiple values (for example, "200,202") or a range of values (for example, "200-299")*

    ***name:** The name of the target group. If omitted, Terraform will assign a random, unique name.
    **port:** The port on which targets receive traffic
    **protocol: **The protocol to use for routing traffic to the targets. Should be one of **"TCP", "TLS", "HTTP" or "HTTPS"**. Required when target_type is instance or ip
    **vpc_id:** The identifier of the VPC in which to create the target group
    **target_type:** The type of target that you must specify when registering targets with this target group.Possible values instance id, ip address*

***Step3:** Provides the ability to register instances with an Application Load Balancer (ALB)*

    *target_group_arn: The ARN of the target group with which to register targets
    target_id: The ID of the target. This is the Instance ID for an instance
    port: The port on which targets receive traffic.*

***Step4:** Security group used by ALB*

* *Final terraform code for Application Load Balancer will look like this*
