As 2019 comes to an end, it’s that time of year when we look to setting new goals, and focusing on what we want to learn next year.

As engineers many of those goals revolve around keeping up with every new technology and framework. In particular, technologies such as [AWS](https://www.theseattledataguy.com/5-aws-technologies-thatll-make-your-life-easier/), Azure and Google Cloud all offer a host of services that can simplify a developers life. However, it can be hard to keep up with all the various new cloud services.

**What is Cloud Architecture?**

Simply put, cloud computing takes many forms but usually removes several layers of management of hardware, software or infrastructure.

These mainly include the back end and front end platform, a network and a cloud based delivery. It is important to note that this design of cloud solutions has been based on architectural methods and procedures developed in the last two decades.

As a software engineer in the modern world, you are often forced to utilize tools like EC2, RDS, [Redshift](https://www.theseattledataguy.com/building-a-data-warehouse-on-amazon-redshift/), DynamoDB, BigQuery, Azure Pipelines, etc. With torrents of new services coming out every year, it is a good idea to at least have a general overview of these various technologies.

Below we have listed 10 courses offered by Amazon, Google, Coursera, Udemy and Edx that can help you keep up!
