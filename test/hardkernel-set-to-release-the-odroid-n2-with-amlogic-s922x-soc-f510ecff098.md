Last year, Hardkernel was forced to cancel the Odroid-N1 development board due to RAM supply issues. The board packed a Rockchip RK3399 SoC, 4GB of RAM, Gigabyte Ethernet, HDMI 2.0 4K UHD, and more, all for about $100. The good news is that Hardkernel has sorted their issues and have announced the Odroid-N2, which offers a more powerful SoC with a cheaper price tag.

Under the hood, the Odroid-N2 features an Amlogic S922X SoC with hexa-core big.LITTLE processor that sports 4X Arm Cortex-A73 cores, 2X Cortex-A53 cores, Mali-G52 GPU, up to 4GB of DDR4 RAM, and 8Mb of SPI Flash, along with an eMMC module socket and micro SD slot for additional storage.

Video and audio are handled by an HDMI 2.1 port (4K @ 75Hz), and composite video jack with stereo line out with 384Hz/32-bit DAC. The board is also equipped with 4X USB 3.0 ports, micro USB OTG 2.0 port, and 40-pin GPIO header (25x GPIO, 2x i2C, 2x ADC, 6x PWM, SPI, UART, SPDIF, etc.). A Gigabyte Ethernet port or optional USB Wi-Fi adapter handles networking; unfortunately, there is no Bluetooth option at this point.
